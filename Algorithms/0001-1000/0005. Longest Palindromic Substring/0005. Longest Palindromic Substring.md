# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string **s**, find the longest palindromic substring in **s**. You may assume that the maximum length of **s** is 1000.

**Example 1:**

**Input: "babad"

**Output:** "bab"

**Note:** "aba" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "cbbd"

**Output:** "bb"

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let `length` be the length of string `s`, and `dp` be a 2D array of `boolean` type that has `length` rows and `length` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j` is a palindrome.

Initially, only the elements on the diagonal of `dp` are `true`. Then consider the substrings with lengths greater than 1. Consider the odd substring lengths and the even substring lengths individually. If a palindromic substring has the maximum length, then update the length and the start index and the end index.

Finally, return the substring from the start index to the end index.
