# 6. ZigZag Conversion
## Level
Medium

## Description

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
```
string convert(string s, int numRows);
```
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:

P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```

## Solution
For a zigzag with `numRows` rows, define a group size as `(numRows - 1) * 2`. In each group, the row index first increases and then decreases, from `0` to `numRows - 1` and to `1`. For each position in the group, the corresponding row index can be calculated, and add the character to the corresponding row.

After all characters are added to the corresponding rows, concatenate the strings row by row and return.
