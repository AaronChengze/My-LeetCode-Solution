# 11. Container With Most Water
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given *n* non-negative integers *a<sub>1</sub>*, *a<sub>2</sub>*, ..., *a<sub>n</sub>*, where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *a<sub>i</sub>*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *a<sub>i</sub>*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example:**

**Input:** [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

**Output:** 49

## Solution
A brute force solution is to compute the areas of all vertical lines pairs, which has a time complexity of O(*n*<sup>2</sup>) is not efficient.

A solution with a time complexity of O(*n*) works as follows. Use pointers `left` and `right`, which points to the leftmost vertical line and the rightmost vertical line initially. At each step, the width of the container is `right - left`, and the height of the container is `Math.min(height[left], height[right])`, and both factors determine the amount of water that the container can contain. After the area is calculated, either move `left` to `left + 1` or `right` to `right - 1`. Since the amount of water that can be contained should be maximized, the maximum height should be maintained, so always move the pointer with a lower height. In this case, the height may increase after moving. If the pointer with a higher height is moved, then the height never increases.
