## Description
Given an array `nums` of n integers, are there elements *a*, *b*, *c* in `nums` such that *a* + *b* + *c* = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example:**
```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

## Solution
First, sort the array. Next, fix the leftmost number each time and find the other two numbers. If the leftmost number is `leftNum`, then the other two numbers should have sum `-leftNum`. Find all such pairs that have sum `-leftNum`, and adding `leftNum` to the pair forms a triplet. For each possible leftmost number, do such procedures.

To find the pairs given the leftmost number, use two pointers that are initially at two ends and move then towards the middle each time.

To avoid duplicates, if a number equals its previous number, then move forwards until the number doesn't equal its previous number.
