# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
## Level
Easy

## Description
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**

**Input:** 1->2->4, 1->3->4

**Output:** 1->1->2->3->4->4

## Solution
Create a `dummyHead` that occurs before the real head of the merged list. Use two pointers `temp1` and `temp2` to point to the current numbers in the two lists. Initially `temp1` and `temp2` point to the two lists' heads respectively. While both `temp1` and `temp2` are in the lists, compare the numbers at `temp1` and `temp2`, add the smaller number to the merged list, and move the corresponding pointer one step ahead. If one pointer reaches the end of the list, which is `null`, then add the numbers of the other pointer to the merged list. Finally, return `dummyHead.next`.
