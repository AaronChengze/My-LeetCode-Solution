# 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

**Example:**

Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

## Solution
Create a `dummyHead` that occurs before `head`, that is, `dummyHead.next = head`. Each time take the two next nodes, and modify the next elements that each node points to. Suppose the current node is `temp`, and the next two nodes are `node1` and `node2` respectively, that is, `node1 = temp.next` and `node2 = temp.next.next`. If `node1 == null` or `node2 == null`, then the end of the list is reached, so stop the process. Otherwise, change the nodes as follows. Let `temp.next = node2`, `node1.next = node2.next`, and `node2.next = node1`. After these steps, `node1` and `node2` are swapped. Move `temp` two steps forward (which should point to `node1` after moving two steps), and do swapping for the next nodes. Finally, return `dummyHead.next`.
