# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log *n*).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0

**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3

**Output:** -1

## Solution
To solve the problem in O(log *n*) runtime complexity, use binary search. Since the sorted array is rotated at some pivot, the logic is a little different from traditional binary search.

Use two pointers `low` and `high`, which initially point to the begin and the end of the array respectively. The loop condition is `low <= high`. Each time choose `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`. If `nums[mid] == target`, then return `mid`. Otherwise, decide which half should be searched next, `[low, mid - 1]` or `[mid + 1, high]`. Two cases may exist. The first case is that `nums[low] <= nums[mid]`, which means the rotation point is on the right of `mid`. Search in `[low, mid - 1]` if `target` is between `nums[low]` and `nums[mid]`, and otherwise search in `[mid + 1, high]`. The first case is that `nums[low] > nums[mid]`, which means the rotation pointer is on the left of `mid`. Search in `[mid + 1, high]` if `target` is between `nums[mid]` and `nums[high]`, and otherwise search in `[low, mid - 1]`. If `target` is not found, return `-1`.
