# 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log *n*).

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

**Output:** [3,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6

**Output:** [-1,-1]

## Solution
Since the runtime complexity is restricted to be in the order of O(log *n*), and the array is sorted, binary search is an ideal solution.

Do binary search two rounds. The first round finds whether the given `target` is in the array `nums`, and if `target` exists, get the index of `target` (if there are duplicates, find any index that has the number `target`).

If the given `target` is not in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

If the given `target` is in the array, do binary search for the second round. Do binary search at both sides of the index found in the first round, and find the leftmost index and the rightmost index of `target`. In the second round, the loop condition of binary search is that the left pointer is less than the right poiner and the equal case is not included in the loop condition, which is a little different from traditional binary search.
