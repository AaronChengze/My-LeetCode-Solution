## Description
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

Empty cells are indicated by the character `'.'`.

...and its solution numbers marked in red.

**Note:**

* The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
* You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique solution.
* The given board size is always `9x9`.

## Solution
Use backtrack. First loop over `board` to find all the empty cells. Then for each empty cell, try each digit. If the digit can be filled in the empty cell to keep the sudoku valid, then move on to the next empty cell. If all the empty cells are filled, then the sudoku is solved, so return. If at one point it is impossible to fill in the empty cell with any digit to keep the sudoku valid, then do backtrack. Do not do backtrack after the sudoku is solved. To determine whether the sudoku is solved, use a global variable of `boolean` type to store the state.

There is another way that can reduce the time. Before doing backtrack, check all empty cells and determine whether an empty cell has a fixed value. Check the row, the column and the sub-box that the empty cell is in, and use the digits that already exist to determine the candidates of the empty cell. If there is only one candidate, then the empty cell's value is fixed, so fill in the empty cell with the fixed value. Fill in fixed values for empty cells until no more empty cells have fixed value. After filling fixed values, do backtrack. Since the number of empty cells is reduced, time can be reduced in backtrack.
