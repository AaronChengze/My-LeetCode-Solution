# 42. Trapping Rain Water
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given *n* non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. **Thanks Marcos** for contributing this image!

**Example:**

**Input:** [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

**Output:** 6

## Solution
If `height` has length 0, then return 0.

Loop over `height` in both directions and use two arrays `leftMax` and `rightMax` to store maximum height in both directions. Each element in the array `leftMax` represents the maximum height in the subarray from the leftmost index to the current index. Each element in the array `rightMax` represents the maximum height in the subarray from the current index to the rightmost index.

For each index `i`, the maximum amount of water trapped at the index is `Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i]`. Thus the total amount of water trapped can be obtained.
