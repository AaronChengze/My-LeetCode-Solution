# 43. Multiply Strings
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num1 = "2", num2 = "3"

**Output:** "6"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num1 = "123", num2 = "456"

**Output:** "56088"

**Note:**

1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 110.
2. Both `num1` and `num2` contain only digits `0-9`.
3. Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
4. You **must not use any built-in BigInteger library** or **convert the inputs to integer** directly.

## Solution
Consider how multiplication is done when two integers are multiplied. Each digit in the first number is multiplied by each digit in the second number, and add carry to higher digits if exists.

Given two numbers represented as strings, multiplication is also done in this way. For both strings, do multiplication from the rightmost digit to the leftmost digit.
