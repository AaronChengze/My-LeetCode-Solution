# 45. Jump Game II
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

**Example:**

**Input:** [2,3,1,1,4]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Note:**

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

## Solution
Use greedy algorithm. Each time, find the maximum position that can be reached. Also a boundary is stored. If the current position equals boundary, then update the boundary to be the maximum position that can be reached, and add step by 1.

Since initially the boundary is 0 and step is already added by 1, so the loop ends at `nums.length - 1`, not `nums.length`.
