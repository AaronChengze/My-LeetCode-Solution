# 47. Permutations II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,1,2]
Output:
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

## Solution
This problem is a follow-up problem of problem 46, and the difference is that in this problem, there maight be duplicates.

In fact, the solution to problem 46 can also apply to this problem as well. To get all permutations, first sort the integers in ascending order, and each time get the next permutation.

To get the next permutation, the last ascending index needs to be obtained, which is the maximum `index` such that `nums[index] < nums[index + 1]`. If such an index doesn't exist, then the array is sorted in descending order, which is the last possible permutation. If such an index exists, find the minimum number that is greater than the current number at position `index` and swap the two numbers, and then sort the numbers after position `index` to get the next permutation.

After all permutations are obtained, return the list of all possible permutations.
