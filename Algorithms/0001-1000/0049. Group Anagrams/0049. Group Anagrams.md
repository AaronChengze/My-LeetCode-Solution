# 49. Group Anagrams
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

**Example:**
```
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```
**Note:**

* All inputs will be in lowercase.
* The order of your output does not matter.

## Solution
For each string that consists of lowercase letters, an array can be obtained which represents the number of each letter in the string. To strings are anagrams of each other if and only if the two strings' corresponding arrays are the same, which means that for any lowercase letter, the numbers of the lowercase letter in both arrays are the same.

To group anagrams, for each string in the array, get the corresponding array of the number of each letter, and use two `Map`s to map each string to its array and map each array to the corresponding anagram group number.

After the number of anagram groups are obtained, for each string, get its anagram group number, and add the string to the corresponding anagram group.
