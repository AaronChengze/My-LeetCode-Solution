Given an integer *n*, return the number of distinct solutions to the *n*-queens puzzle.

**Example:**
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```

## Solution
This problem is similar to problem 51. This problem is also solved using backtracking. The difference between this problem and problem 51 is that this problem requires returning the number of distinct solutions, not returning the solutions, so return the number of distinct solutions when calling the method of backtracking.
