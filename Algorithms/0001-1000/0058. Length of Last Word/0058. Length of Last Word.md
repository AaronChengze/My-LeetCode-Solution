# 58. Length of Last Word
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string *s* consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters `' '`, return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

**Note:** A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

**Example:**

**Input:** "Hello World"

**Output:** 5

## Solution
The solution is quite straightforward. Get the length of the string and the index of the last space character in the string, and the length of last word can be calculated. If there is no space in the string, then the whole string is the last word.
