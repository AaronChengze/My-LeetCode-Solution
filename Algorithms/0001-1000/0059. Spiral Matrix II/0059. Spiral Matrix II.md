# 59. Spiral Matrix II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a positive integer *n*, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to *n*<sup>2</sup> in spiral order.

**Example:**
```
Input: 3
Output:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
]
```

## Solution
The solution to this problem is similar to problem 54, but in this problem the numbers are to be written into the matrix.

Starting from the top left corner and direction right, visit each element in spiral order. Use a 2D array of `boolean` type `visited` to record whether each cell is visited. Each time visit the current cell, set the value in the current cell and set the state of the current cell in `visited` to `true`. Then check the next cell using the current direction. If the next cell is out of the boundary or is already visited, then change to the next direction and move to the next cell using the new direction. Repeat the steps until all the cells are visited.
