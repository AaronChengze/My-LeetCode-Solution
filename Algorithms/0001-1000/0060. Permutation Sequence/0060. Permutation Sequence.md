# 60. Permutation Sequence
## Level
Medium

## Description
The set `[1,2,3,...,n]` contains a total of *n*! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for *n* = 3:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given *n* and *k*, return the *k*<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence.

**Note:**

* Given *n* will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
* Given *k* will be between 1 and *n*! inclusive.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 3

**Output:** "213"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, k = 9

**Output:** "2314"

## Solution
The first permutation sequence is all digits sorted in ascending order. To get the *k*<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence, get the next permutation sequence for *k* - 1 times.

To get the next permutation sequence, the last ascending index needs to be obtained, which is the maximum `index` such that the digit at `index` is less than the digit at `index + 1`. If such an index doesn't exist, then the array is sorted in descending order, which is the last possible permutation. If such an index exists, find the minimum digit that is greater than the current digit at position `index` and swap the two digits, and then sort the digits after position `index` to get the next permutation sequence.
