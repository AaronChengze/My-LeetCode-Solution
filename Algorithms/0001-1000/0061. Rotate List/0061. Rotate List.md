# 61. Rotate List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by *k* places, where *k* is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, k = 2

**Output:** 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

**Explanation:**

rotate 1 steps to the right: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL

rotate 2 steps to the right: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 0->1->2->NULL, k = 4

**Output:** 2->0->1->NULL

**Explanation:**

rotate 1 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL

rotate 2 steps to the right: 1->2->0->NULL

rotate 3 steps to the right: 0->1->2->NULL

rotate 4 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL

## Solution
If the list has length 0 or 1, or `k` is 0, then simply return the list.

Calculate the length `length` of the list, and set `k` to be `k % length` since rotating `length` steps makes the list rotate back to the initial state.

Use two pointers `pointer1` and `pointer2` to point to two nodes in the list, where `pointer2` is `k` places ahead of `pointer1`.

Each time move both `pointer1` and `pointer2` forward by 1 place, until `pointer2.next == null`. At this pointer, `pointer1` is the new end of the rotated list, `pointer1.next` is the new head of the rotated list, and the last node (which is `pointer2` at this point) should has `next` pointing to the original head.

After modifying the pointers, return the new head of the list.
