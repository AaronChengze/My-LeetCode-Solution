Easy

## Description
Given a **non-empty** array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3]

**Output:** [1,2,4]

**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [4,3,2,1]

**Output:** [4,3,2,2]

**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 4321.

## Solution
If the original integer has all digits 9, then the result will have length added by 1, which has 1 at the most significant digit and 0 at all other digits.

For other cases, add 1 to the last element in the array. While the digit is greater than or equal to 10, do mod 10 operation on the digit and add the carry to the left digit. Repeat the procedure until no carry is left.
