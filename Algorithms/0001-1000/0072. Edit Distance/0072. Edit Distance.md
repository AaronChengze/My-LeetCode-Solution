# 72. Edit Distance
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of operations required to convert *word1* to *word2*.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')

rorse -> rose (remove 'r')

rose -> ros (remove 'e')

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

intention -> inention (remove 't')

inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')

enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')

exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')

exection -> execution (insert 'u')

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let `length1` and `length2` be the lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively. Let `dp` be a 2D array with `length1 + 1` rows and `length2 + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the two substrings, which are the first `i` characters of `word1` and the first `j` characters of `word2`. Obviously, if one of the substrings has length 0, the edit distance of the two substrings equals the length of the other substring. For index `i` in `word1` and index `j` in `word2`, check whether the two characters at the two indices in the two strings are the same. If the characters are the same, then adding this character to both substrings will not change the edit distance, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]`. If the characters are different, then the three operations insertion, deletion and replacement should all be tried, which counts as 1 operation, and the minimum number of operations before the current operation is considered, so `dp[i][j] = Math.min(Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]), dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1`.

Finally, return `dp[length1][length2]`, which represents the edit distance between `word1` and `word2`.
