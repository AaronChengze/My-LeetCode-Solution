## Description
Given a *m* x *n* matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,2,0],
  [3,4,5,2],
  [1,3,1,5]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [0,4,5,0],
  [0,3,1,0]
]
```

* A straight forward solution using O(*mn*) space is probably a bad idea.
* A simple improvement uses O(*m* + *n*) space, but still not the best solution.
* Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Solution
To set the values in a matrix in-place, one solution is to scan over the matrix, find the elements that equal 0, and store the rows and the columns. Then for the rows and the columns, set all the elements to 0.
