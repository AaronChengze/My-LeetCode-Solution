# 74. Search a 2D Matrix
## Level
Medium

## Description
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an *m* x *n* matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

* Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
* The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 13
Output: false
```

## Solution
Since the matrix is sorted ascending in each row, and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row, the *m* x *n* matrix can be reshaped to a 1D array, where each row is concatenated after the previous row, and binary search can be done on the 1D array.

In practice, the reshape procedure is not necessary and only the idea needs to be used. Initially, set `low` to be 0 and `high` to be *m* x *n* - 1. The loop condition is `low <= high`. Each time, select `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high`, find the row and the column according to `mid`, and check the number. The rest procedure is the same as binary search.
