## Description
Given two integers *n* and *k*, return all possible combinations of *k* numbers out of 1 ... *n*.

**Example:**
```
Input:Â n = 4, k = 2
Output:
[
  [2,4],
  [3,4],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  [1,3],
  [1,4],
]
```

## Solution
If `n` is less than `k`, then no possible combinations exist, so return an empty list. The combinations exist only if `n` is equal to or greater than `k`.

Get all the combinations by order. The first combination is `[1, ..., k]`. At each step, add the current combination to the return list and get the next combination. If the current combination is `[n - k + 1, ..., n]`, then the current combination is the last possible combination and the next combination is empty, so stop the procedure.

The method to get the next combination works as follows. If the last number in the current combination is less than `n`, then just increase the last number in the current combination by 1, and the next combination is obtained. Otherwise, find the last position `changeIndex` such that `combination.get(changeIndex + 1) - combination.get(changeIndex) > 1`, increase the number at `changeIndex` by 1 and set the following numbers to the smallest possible combination that follows. For example, `n` = 10 and `k` = 4, and the current combination is `[3,4,9,10]`, then `changeIndex` equals 1, which points to the number 4. Increase the number at `changeIndex` by 1, which changes to 5, and the next combination is `[3,5,6,7]`.
