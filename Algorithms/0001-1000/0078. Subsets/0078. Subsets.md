## Description
Given a set of **distinct** integers, *nums*, return all possible subsets (the power set).

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Solution
Start from the empty set, each time add one number to the previous set to create a new subset with a size increased by 1.

Use a queue to store the subsets that has just visited. Initially the empty set is added to the power set and offered to the queue.

Each time a previous subset is polled, get the index of the last element in the previous subset (in the order of the given array `nums`), and for each element after the last element in the previous subset, add the new element to the previous subset to create a new subset. Add the new subset to the power set and offer the new subset to the queue.

Why only consider the elements after the last element in the previous subset? In this way there won't be duplicate subsets. Consider the given array is `[1,2,3,4,5]`, and the previous subset is `[2,4]`, only the new subset `[2,4,5]` is considered, and the new subset `[2,3,4]` is not considered here since it was already considered when the previous subset was `[2,3]` and `4` was added to create a new subset.
