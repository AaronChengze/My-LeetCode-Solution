## Description
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:

board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.
```

## Solution
Use depth first search and backtrack. First find all the cells that have the letter equal to the first letter in `word`. Then do depth first search starting from each of the cells. For each cell in `board` visited, its value must be equal to the current letter in `word`. Then consider its adjacent cells that haven't been visited, and do further search. If a word is found, return `true`. Otherwise, do backtrack to return to the previous step and try another direction. If the word is not found, return `false`.
