# 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3

**Output:** false

**Follow up:**

* This is a follow up problem to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain duplicates.
* Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## Solution
This is a follow-up problem to problem 33. Since the array may contain duplicates, the solution to this problem is a little different to the solution to problem 33. A few statements are added for the case `nums[low] == nums[mid]`, where `low` should be added by 1. This is to avoid infinity loop when both numbers at indices `low` and `high` are equal to the number at index `mid`. The rest of the solution is the same as problem 33, so the run-time complexity is still O(log *n*).
