# 87. Scramble String
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string *s1*, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of *s1* = `"great"`:
```
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node `"gr"` and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string `"rgeat"`.
```
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```
We say that `"rgeat"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes `"eat"` and `"at"`, it produces a scrambled string `"rgtae"`.
```
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
```
We say that `"rgtae"` is a scrambled string of `"great"`.

Given two strings *s1* and *s2* of the same length, determine if *s2* is a scrambled string of *s1*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"

**Output:** false

## Solution
If `s1` and `s2` have different lengths, then it is impossible that `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, so return `false`.

Use dynamic programming. Suppose the length of `s1` and `s2` is `length`. Create a 3D array `dp` of size `length * length * length` and type `boolean`, where `dp[i][j][k]` represents whether `s2.substring(j, j + k + 1)` is a scrambled string of `s1.substring(i, i + k + 1)`. For all `0 <= i < length` and `0 <= j < length`, initialize `dp[i][j][0]` such that `dp[i][j][0] = true` if and only if `s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)`.

For `curLength` from 2 to `length`, let `maxStart = length - curLength`. Then for `i` from 0 to `maxStart` and for `j` from 0 to `maxStart`, `dp[i][j][curLength - 1] = true` if and only if there exists a `k` such that `1 <= k < curLength` and the first `k` letters in substring of `s1` matches the first `k` letters in substring of `s2` and the last `curLength - k` letters in substring of `s1` matches the last `curLength - k` letters in substring of `s2`, or the first `k` letters in substring of `s1` matches the last `k` letters in substring of `s2` and the last `curLength - k` letters in substring of `s1` matches the fist `curLength - k` letters in substring of `s2`.

Finally, return `dp[0][0][length - 1]`.
