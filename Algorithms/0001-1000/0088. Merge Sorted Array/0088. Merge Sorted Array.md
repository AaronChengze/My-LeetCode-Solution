# 88. Merge Sorted Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two sorted integer arrays *nums1* and *nums2*, merge *nums2* into *nums1* as one sorted array.

Note:

* The number of elements initialized in *nums1* and *nums2* are *m* and *n* respectively.
* You may assume that *nums1* has enough space (size that is greater or equal to *m* + *n*) to hold additional elements from *nums2*.

**Example:**

**Input:**

nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3

nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

**Output:** [1,2,2,3,5,6]

## Solution
To avoid overwriting elements in `nums1` before the elements are put in the correct positions, start from the end of the array and put elements to the correct positions backwards.

Let `index1` and `index2` be indices in original arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, and `index` be the index in merged array `nums1`. Initially, `index1 = m - 1`, `index2 = n - 1` and `index = m + n - 1`.

While both `index1` and `index2` are greater than or equal to 0, each time compare the elements `nums1[index1]` and `nums2[index2]`, and put the greater elements to `nums1[index]`. Reduce `index1` by 1, and reduce either `index1` or `index2` by 1 where the element is put to `nums1[index]`.

When only one array has remaining elements, put the elements from the array to the remaining positions in `nums1[index]`.
