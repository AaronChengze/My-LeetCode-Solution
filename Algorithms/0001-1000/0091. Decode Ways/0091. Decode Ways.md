# 91. Decode Ways
## Level
Medium

## Description
A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```
Given a **non-empty** string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "12"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "226"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let `length` be the length of `s`, and create an array `dp` which has size `length + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring of `s` starting from index `i`, and `dp[0]` is the result.

Obviously, `dp[length] = 1` since there is only one way to decode an empty string. For index `i`, if the character at index `i` of `s` is `'0'`, then `dp[i] = 0` since the encoded digits string can never start with `'0'`. Otherwise, consider whether a one-digit number and a two-digit number starting from index `i` can be obtained, and update the number of ways of decoding accordingly.
