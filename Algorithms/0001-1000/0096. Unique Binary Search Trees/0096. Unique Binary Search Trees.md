# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given *n*, how many structurally unique **BST's** (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... `n`?

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

## Solution
If *n* equals 0 or 1, then obviously the result is 1.

For the other cases, if a binary search tree contains *n* nodes, then any node can be a root node. Suppose the *k*<sup>th</sup> node is the root, then there are *k*-1 nodes in the left subtree and *n*-*k* nodes in the right subtree, so there are (*k* - 1) * (*n* - *k*) structurally unique binary search trees with *n* nodes and the *k*<sup>th</sup> node as the root. Sum up the number of unique binary search trees for the cases each node is the root.
