# 100. Same Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]

Output: false
```

## Solution
Do breadth first search on the two binary trees simultaneously, starting from both trees' roots.

If the two binary trees are the same, at each step, the nodes visited in both trees should have the same value. If at one step, the nodes visited in the two binary trees have different values, or exactly one binary tree's visited node is `null`, then the two binary trees are different and return `false`. If after search is finished and no difference found, then the two binary trees are the same and return `true`.
