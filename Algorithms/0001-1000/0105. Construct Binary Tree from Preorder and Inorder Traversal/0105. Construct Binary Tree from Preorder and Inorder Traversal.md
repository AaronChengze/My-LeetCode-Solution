# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**

You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```
Return the following binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

## Solution
This problem can be solved either recursively or iteratively.

For the recursive solution, find the root value's index in the inorder traversal (the root value is the first element in preorder traversal), and the numbers of nodes in the left subtree and the right subtree can be determined, and the left subtree and the right subtree can be constructed recursively.

For the iterative solution, use the idea of preorder traversal and check whether the current value in preorder traversal equals the current value in inorder traversal. If the values in preorder traversal and inorder traversal match, then the nodes' relations (parent and left/right child) can be determined.
