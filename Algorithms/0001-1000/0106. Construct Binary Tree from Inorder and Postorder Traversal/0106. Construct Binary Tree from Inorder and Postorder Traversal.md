# 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**

You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
```
Return the following binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

```

## Solution
Similar to problem 105, this problem can be solved either recursively or iteratively.

For the recursive solution, find the root value's index in the inorder traversal (the root value is the last element in postorder traversal), and the numbers of nodes in the left subtree and the right subtree can be determined, and the left subtree and the right subtree can be constructed recursively.

For the iterative solution, consider reversing the postorder traversal. If postorder traversal is reversed, then it is the same as preorder traversal, but with the right child of each node visited before the left child. Also, the inorder traversal also needs to be reversed. Then the solution is similar to problem 105.
