# 115. Distinct Subsequences
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string **S** and a string **T**, count the number of distinct subsequences of **S** which equals **T**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `t.length() + 1` rows and `s.length() + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of `s.substring(j)` that equals `t.substring(i)`. For the last row of `dp`, which represents that the postfix of `s` is empty, initialize all the elements to 1.

Then for each element `dp[i][j]` where `0 <= i < t.length()` and `0 <= j < s.length()`, if `t.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j + 1] + dp[i][j + 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j + 1]`.

Finally, return `dp[0][0]`.
