# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
## Level
Easy

## Description
Say you have an array for which the *i*<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [7,1,5,3,6,4]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [7,6,4,3,1]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## Solution
Loop over the array and keep the minimum price, which is `Integer.MAX_VALUE` initially. If the current price is lower than the previous minimum price, then update the minimum price with the current price, and the maximum profit can't be updated since the minimum price is at the current day so far and a stock can't be sold before it is bought. If the current price is not lower than the previous minimum price, then the stock could be bought at the minimum price and check whether selling the stock at the current day can make the maximum profit. If so, update the maximum profit.

Finally, return the maximum profit.
