# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42
```

## Solution
Use a global variable to store the maximum path sum. Use recursion to obtain the maximum single path sum. Here the single path sum means a path that only goes down from parents to children.

If a node is `null`, then the maximum single path sum of the node is 0. For a non-empty node, obtain its to children's maximum single path sums, and update the node's maximum single path sum using the two children's maximum single path sums and the node's value. The global variable of the maximum path sum is updated as the maximum possible sum of the node's value and its two children's maximum single paths (if one of the values is negative, then do not use it).

Finally, return the global variable of the maximum path sum.
