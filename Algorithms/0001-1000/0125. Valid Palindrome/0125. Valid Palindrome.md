# 125. Valid Palindrome
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

**Note:** For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "race a car"

**Output:** false

## Solution
Since cases are ignored, transfer the given string to lower case.

Consider how to determine whether a string is a palindrome without any restrictions. Use two pointers which point to begin and end initially, and check whether the two characters that the two pointers point to are the same.

In this problem, only alphanumeric characters are considered. Therefore, if a character is not alphanumeric, then move to the next position (the left pointer moves right by 1 step or the right pointer moves left by 1 step), until the current character is alphanumeric. Then only check whether the alphanumeric characters that the two pointers point to are the same.
