## Description
Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.

**Note:**

* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Each time all the words with the same number of transformation are visited.

Starting from `beginWord`, check each word in `wordList`. If a word in `wordList` has not been visited and the word in `wordList` and the current word differ by 1, then return the length of transformation sequence if the word in `wordList` equals `endWord`, or add the word in `wordList` to the queue for searching in the next step otherwise.

If `endWord` can't be reached, return 0.
