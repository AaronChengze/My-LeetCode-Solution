# 130. Surrounded Regions
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (**the letter O**), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running your function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldn¡¯t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

## Solution
Use depth first search. The `'O'`s on the border are not surrounded, so do depth first search on the `'O'`s on the border to set them to another character `'B'`. After doing depth first search, all the `'O'`s on the boarder or are connected to the `'O'`s on the boarder are changed to `'B'`. Then loop over the board. When looping over the board, change all `'O'`s to `'X'` and change all `'B'`s to `'O'`.
