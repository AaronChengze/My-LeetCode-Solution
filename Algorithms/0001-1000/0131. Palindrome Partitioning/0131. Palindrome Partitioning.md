# 131. Palindrome Partitioning
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string *s*, partition *s* such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of *s*.

**Example:**
```
Input: "aab"
Output:
[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]
```

## Solution
First consider simple cases when *s* has length 0 or 1. If *s* has length 0, then the result list should contain an empty list. If *s* has length 1, then the result list should contain a list that contains only the string *s*.

If *s* has length greater than 1, use recursion. For `i` from 1 to `s.length()`, consider all substrings `s.substring(0, i)`. If the substring is not a palindrome, then skip the substring. Otherwise, if `i` equals `s.length()`, then no more characters remaining for partition, so in this case the partition only contains one element, which is *s* itself. If `i` is less than `s.length()`, then do partition on the remaining characters, and add the first substring to the beginning of each partition list.
