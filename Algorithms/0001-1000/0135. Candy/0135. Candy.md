# 135. Candy
## Level
Hard

## Description
There are *N* children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,0,2]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively. The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

## Solution
Suppose `candies` is an array of length `N`. If `i` and `j` are two adjacent indices in the array (that is, `0 <= i < j < N` and `j - i == 1`), then if `ratings[i] > ratings[j]`, there must be `candies[i] > candies[j]`, and if `ratings[i] < ratings[j]`, there must be `candies[i] < candies[j]`. The minimum candies of each child is obtained by looping `ratings` in two directions.

Use two arrays `left` and `right` to store the minimum candies of each child when looping over `ratings` from left to right and from right to left, respectively. Initialize both arrays so that all elements are 1.

For `i` from 1 to `N - 1`, if `ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]`, then set `left[i] = left[i - 1] + 1`, since the child at index `i` must get more candies than the child at index `i - 1`.

For `i` from `N - 2` to 0, if `ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]`, then set `right[i] = right[i + 1] + 1`, since the child at index `i` must get more candies than the child at index `i + 1`.

For `0 <= i < N`, the minimum number of candies that the child at index `i` gets is the maximum of `left[i]` and `right[i]`. Calculate the sum of all chiodren's minimum numbers of candies and return.
