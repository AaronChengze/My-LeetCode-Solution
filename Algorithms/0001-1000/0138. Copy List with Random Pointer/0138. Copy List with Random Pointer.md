# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer
## Level
Medium

## Description
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a **[deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy)** of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

* `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
* `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) where random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

**Example 1:**

**Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Output:** [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

**Example 2:**
![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e2.png)
**Input:** head = [[1,1],[2,1]]

**Output:** [[1,1],[2,1]]

**Example 3:**
![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e3.png)
**Input:** head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

**Output:** [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** head = []

**Output:** []

**Explanation:** Given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.

**Constraints:**

* `-10000 <= Node.val <= 10000`
* `Node.random` is null or pointing to a node in the linked list.
* Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.

## Solution
A deep copy means that fields are dereferenced and new copy objects are created for any referenced objects.

To do a deep copy, the first step is to copy the nodes but only keep the values, while all reference fields are `null` initially.

After the first step, the nodes are copied but no value for reference fields. For each node, the two reference fields `next` and `random` needs to be assigned corresponding values.

Assigning values to the field `next` of each node is quite straightforward. Make each node's `next` field point to the node in the next position, while the last node's `next` field shoud point to `null`.

To assign values to the field `random` of each node, the original list should be used to get the index of the node that field `random` points to. Once the indices are obtained, it can be determined that which node the field `random` points to for each node.
