# 140. Word Break II
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a **non-empty** string s and a dictionary *wordDict* containing a list of **non-empty** words, add spaces in *s* to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences.

**Note:**

* The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
* You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output:
[
  "cats and dog",
  "cat sand dog"
]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
s = "pineapplepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple"]
Output:
[
  "pine apple pen apple",
  "pineapple pen apple",
  "pine applepen apple"
]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input:
s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output:
[]
```

## Solution
To avoid time limit exceed, first use the solution to problem 139 to determine whether at least one way of word break exists. If the work break doesn't exist, return an empty list.

If the work break exists, then use breadth first search to find the sentences. Starting from index 0, check whether a substring starting from the current index is in the dictionary. If so, add the end index to the queue, and update the current sentence for further search. If the index reaches `s.length()`, then add the sentence to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
