# 143. Reorder List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a singly linked list *L*: *L*<sub>0</sub>→*L*<sub>1</sub>→…→*L*<sub>*n*-1</sub>→*L*<sub>*n*</sub>,

reorder it to: *L*<sub>0</sub>→*L*<sub>*n*</sub>→*L*<sub>1</sub>→*L*<sub>*n*-1</sub>→*L*<sub>2</sub>→*L*<sub>*n*-2</sub>→…

You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

**Example 1:**
```
Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Given 1->2->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.
```

## Solution
If the list contains no more than 2 nodes, then the list is not changed, so return.

Find the first node in the right part using two pointers `fast` and `slow`. Initially both pointers point to `head`. Each time move `fast` two steps forward and `slow` one step forward, until `fast` becomes `null`. At this point, `slow` points to the first node in the right part. Then use a stack to store all the nodes in the right part.

Each time obtain the leftmost remaining node in the left part and the rightmost remaining node from the right part (by popping one node from the stack) and reorder them. After all the nodes are reordered, in the new list, set the last node's next to `null`.
