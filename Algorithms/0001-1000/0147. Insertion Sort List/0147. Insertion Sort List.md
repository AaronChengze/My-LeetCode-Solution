A graphical example of insertion sort. The partial sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list.
With each iteration one element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list

**Algorithm of Insertion Sort:**

1. Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list.
2. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
3. It repeats until no input elements remain.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 4->2->1->3

**Output:** 1->2->3->4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** -1->5->3->4->0

**Output:** -1->0->3->4->5

## Solution
If the given list contains only 0 or 1 element, then return the head.

Consider how insertion sort works. There is a sorted sublist starting from index 0, and the sublist grows in each iteration until the sublist's size equals the whole list's size.

In each iteration, store the last sorted node. If the last sorted node's next node has an equal value or a greater value, then simply add the next node to the sorted sublist and assign the next node to the last sorted node.

If the last sorted node's next node has a value less than the last sorted node's value, then the next node should be inserted somewhere before the last sorted node. Since the list is a singly-linked list, use a stack to store the nodes in the sorted sublist. Pop elements out of the stack until the stack is empty or the top element in the stack has a value equal to or less than the next node's value. Then the next node is inserted at this point, and the adjacent node's relations are modified. Also the last sorted node's next node is modified.

Iterate until the last sorted node is the last node in the list, or the last sorted node's `next` data field points to `null`.
