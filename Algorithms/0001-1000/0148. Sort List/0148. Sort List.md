# 148. Sort List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Sort a linked list in O(*n* log *n*) time using constant space complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 4->2->1->3

**Output:** 1->2->3->4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** -1->5->3->4->0

**Output:** -1->0->3->4->5

## Solution
To sort the list in O(*n* log *n*) time, merge sort should be considered. To use constant space complexity, only use several extra pointers.

To do merge sort, the middle node of the list should be found. Use two pointers to find the middle node. Each time the fast pointer moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step. When the fast pointer moves to the end, the slow pointer points the middle node. After finding the middle node, do merge sort for two parts of the node respectively, and merge the two parts after both parts are sorted.

Two merge two parts of a list, always find the node with the smallest number each time and append the node to the sorted list.
