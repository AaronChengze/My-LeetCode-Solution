## Solution
The solution is quite straightforward. Each time select two points from `points` and calculate the straight line that has the two points lying on it. Suppose the two points are `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` respectively, the straight line has the form `a * x + b * y + c = 0`. If `x1 == x2`, then `(a, b, c) = (1, 0, -x1)`. If `y1 == y2`, then `(a, b, c) = (0, 1, -y1)`. Otherwise, calculate `a = y2 - y1` and `b = x1 - x2`, and calculate `c` accordingly. Then calculate the greatest common divisor of `a`, `b` and `c` and divide the coefficients by the greatest common divisor. Also always make `a` non-negative to avoid duplicates. After the straight line is calculated, loop over all the points in `points` and check the number of points that lie on the straight line. Obtain the maximum number of points and return.

To avoid overflow, use data type `long` for coefficients. To reduce runtime, if a straight line has already been calculated before, then skip the straight line. Use a set to store the string form of coefficients to check whether a straight line has already been calculated before.
