# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,4,5,1,2]

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

**Output:** 0

## Solution
First, check whether the array is rotated. If the first element is less than the last element, then the array is not rotated, so return the first element, which is the element at index 0.

Next, use binary search to find the minimum. Initially `low` and `high` point to the leftmost index and the rightmost index. If `high` and `low` differ by only 1, then return the minimum between the numbers at indices `low` and `high`. Otherwise, set `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`, and compare the number at index `low` and the number at index `mid`. If the number at index `mid` is greater, then the rotate point is on the right of `mid`, so set `low = mid`. Otherwise, the rotate point is on the left of `mid`, so set `high = mid`.
