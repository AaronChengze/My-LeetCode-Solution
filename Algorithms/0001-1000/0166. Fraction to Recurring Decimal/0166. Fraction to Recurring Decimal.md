# 166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numerator = 1, denominator = 2

**Output:** "0.5"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numerator = 2, denominator = 1

**Output:** "2"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numerator = 2, denominator = 3

**Output:** "0.(6)"

## Solution
If the fraction is negative, separate the negative sign. Set both numerator and denominator to their absolute values. To avoid overflow, use `long` type.

If the fraction has an absolute value greater than 1, separate the integer part and the remainder that is less than the denominator is assigned to the numerator.

If the remainder is 0, then simply return the string of the integer.

If the remainder is not 0, use a `Set` to store the remainders that have already occured and use a `Map` to store each remainder and its first occurring position. Each time append the current digit from division to the quotient's decimal part, and multiply the remainder by 10 for the next digit in the quotient. If at one point the remainder becomes 0, then this is a finite decimal and return the decimal. Otherwise, there will be a point that the remainder is repeated, and the repeating part can be found. Add parentheses before and after the repeating part.
