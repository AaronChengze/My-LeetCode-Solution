# 186. Reverse Words in a String II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an input string , reverse the string word by word. 

**Example:**

**Input:**  ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]

**Output:** ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]

**Note:**

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* The words are always separated by a single space.

**Follow up:** Could you do it *in-place* without allocating extra space?

## Solution
This problem is solved in two steps.

Step 1: Reverse the letters in each word. Since words are split by spaces, find the start index and the end index of each word, and reverse the characters from the start index and the end index.

Step 2: Reverse the entire array.

After the two steps, the words in the string are reversed. Since each word is reversed twice, all words are the same as the original words. Since the entire array is reversed once, the order of words are entirely reversed.
