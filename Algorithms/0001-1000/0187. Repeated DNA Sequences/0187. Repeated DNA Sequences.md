# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences
## Level
Medium

## Description
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

**Example:**

**Input:** s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

**Output:** ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

## Solution
Check all substrings in the DNA molecule with length 10. That is, for every possible start index, check the substring with length 10 from the start index. Use two sets to store substrings. The first set stores the substrings visited so far, and the second set stores the repeated substrings. If a substring is already in the first set, then add it to the second set.

Finally, return a list that contains all substrings from the second set.
