# 199. Binary Tree Right Side View
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the *right* side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1, 3, 4]
Explanation:

   1            <---
 /   \
2     3         <---
 \     \
  5     4       <---
```

## Solution
Use breadth first search. In each iteration, all the nodes at the same level are visited. For each level, add the rightmost node's value to the result list.
