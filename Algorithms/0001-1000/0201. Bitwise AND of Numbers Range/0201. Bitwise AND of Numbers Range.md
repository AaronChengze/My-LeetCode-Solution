## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [5,7]

**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [0,1]

**Output:** 0

## Solution
Each time find the leftmost bit that is 1 in `m` and the leftmost bit that is 1 in `n`. If the two leftmost bits are different, then the bitwise AND operation on the remaining bits must be 0, so return the current result.

The reason is as follows. Suppose the leftmost bit in `m` is the number `log1` bit from the right side and the leftmost bit in `n` is the number `log2` bit from the right side. Since `m <= n`, it can be seen that `log1 <= log2`. If the two leftmost bits are different, then `log1` and `log2` are different, so `log1 < log2`. Let `num` be `1 << log2`, then there is `m <= num - 1 < num <= n`. Since `num - 1` consists of `log2` bits of 1 as the rightmost bits, and `num` has 1 bit of 1 followed by `log2` bits of 0 as the rightmost bits (the higher bits in `num` and `num - 1` are all 0), it can be seen that the bitwise AND operation result on `num` and `num - 1` is 0, so the bitwise AND operation result from `m` to `n` is 0.

The result will be greater than 0 only if the leftmost bit that is 1 in `m` and the leftmost bit that is 1 in `n` are the same. If this is the case, then `log1 == log2`, so add `1 << log1` to the result and remove the leftmost bit that is 1 from both `m` and `n`. Continue the process on the remaining values of `m` and `n`.
