# 204. Count Primes
## Level
Easy

## Description
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, ***n***.

**Example:**

**Input:** 10

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

## Solution
For each positive integer less than `n`, determine whether it is a prime number and count the prime numbers.

To determine whether a positive integer `num` is a prime number, first check whether `num` is 1. If so, return `false`. Then for each positive integer `i` less than or equal to the square root of `num`, check whether `num % i == 0`. If such a positive integer `i` exists, then `num` is a composite number and thus return `false`. If there is no positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of `num` such that `num` is divisible by the positive integer, then `num` is a prime number.
