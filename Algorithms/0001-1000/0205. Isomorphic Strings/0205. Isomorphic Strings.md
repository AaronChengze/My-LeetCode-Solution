# 205. Isomorphic Strings
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two strings ***s*** and ***t***, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in ***s*** can be replaced to get ***t***.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ***s*** = "egg", ***t*** = "add"

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ***s*** = "foo", ***t*** = "bar"

**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** ***s*** = "paper", ***t*** = "title"

**Output:** true

**Note:**

You may assume both ***s*** and ***t*** have the same length.

## Solution
If two strings areisomorphic, then there exist bijections between the characters in the two strings. For each character at the same index of ***s*** and ***t***, in the first map, map the character in ***s*** to the character in ***t***, and in the second map, map the character in ***t*** to the character in ***s***. If all maps can be done, return `true`. If there is a conflict, return `false`.
