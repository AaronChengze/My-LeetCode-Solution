# 214. Shortest Palindrome
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string ***s***, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "aacecaaa"

**Output:** "aaacecaaa"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "abcd"

**Output:** "dcbabcd"

## Solution
Find the longest palindromic prefix of `s`. Obtain the string `reversed` which contains the reversed content of `s`, and find the smallest `index` such that `s.substring(0, s.length() - index)` equals `reversed.substring(index)`. Then `s.substring(0, s.length() - index)` is the longest palindromic prefix of `s`.

After the longest palindromic prefix is found, reverse the remaining part of `s` and append the reversed substring to the front of `s`.
