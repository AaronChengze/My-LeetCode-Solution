# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Find the **k**th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2

**Output:** 5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4

**Output:** 4

**Note:**

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

## Solution
Use a priority queue to store the k largest elements. The priority queue contains at most k elements and the smallest element is polled from the priority queue first.

For the first k elements in the array, offer them to the priority queue. For the rest elements in the array, compare each element with the smallest element in the priority queue. If the element in the array is greater, then offer the element to the priority queue and poll one element from the priority queue. Otherwise, do not offer the element to the queue.

After all the elements in the array are visited, the priority queue contains the k largest elements, so poll one element from the priority queue, which is the kth largest element, and return.
