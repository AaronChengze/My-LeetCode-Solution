# 223. Rectangle Area
## Level
Medium

## Description
Find the total area covered by two **rectilinear** rectangles in a **2D** plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

**Example:**

**Input:** A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2

**Output:** 45

**Note:**

Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of **int**.

## Solution
First compute the areas of the two rectangles, which are (C - A) * (D - B) and (G - E) * (H - F) respectively.

Next compute the overlap area, which must also be a rectangle. Figure out the width and the height of the overlap rectangle, and calculate the overlap area, which may be 0 or positive.

Finally, the total area equals the sum of the areas of the two rectangles minus the overlap area.

To avoid overflow, use **long** data type in calculation, and convert the result into **int** before returning the result.
