# 231. Power of Two
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1

**Output:** true
 
**Explanation:** 2<sup>0</sup> = 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 16

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** 2<sup>4</sup> = 16

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 218

**Output:** false

## Solution
If `n` is not a positive integer, it can't be a power of two, so return `false`. Divide `n` by 2 until `n` can't be divisible by 2. If `n` is a power of two, then it will eventually become 1. If `n` is not 1 after dividing `n` by 2 repeatedly, then `n` is not a power of two.
