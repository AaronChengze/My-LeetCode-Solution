# 238. Product of Array Except Self
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `nums` of *n* integers where *n* > 1, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

**Input:**  [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** [24,12,8,6]

**Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O(*n*).

**Follow up:**

Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

## Solution
To solve this problem without division, use multiplication to calculate product of numbers on each side of each number.

Use an array `left` to store the product of numbers on the left of each number, and use an array `right` to store the product of numbers on the right of each number. Finally, multiply the numbers in the two arrays element-wise, which is the required output.
