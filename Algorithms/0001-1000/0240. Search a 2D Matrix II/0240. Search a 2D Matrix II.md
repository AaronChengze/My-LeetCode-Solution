# 240. Search a 2D Matrix II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an *m* x *n* matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

* Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
* Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example:**

Consider the following matrix:
```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```
Given target = `5`, return `true`.

Given target = `20`, return `false`.

## Solution
Since each row in the matrix is sorted and each column in the matrix is sorted, use the idea of binary search.

Get the integer at the middle row and the middle column. If the integer equals `target`, return `true`. If the integer is greater than `target`, search in the rows above the current row and search in the columns to the left of the current column. If the integer is less than `target`, search in the rows under the current row and search in the columns to the right of the current column. If an integer equal to `target` is found, return `true`. If the subarea to be searched is empty, return `false`.
