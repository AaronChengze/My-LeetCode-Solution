# 241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string of numbers and operators, return all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators. The valid operators are `+`, `-` and `*`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "2-1-1"

**Output:** [0, 2]

**Explanation:**

((2-1)-1) = 0 

(2-(1-1)) = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "2*3-4*5"

**Output:** [-34, -14, -10, -10, 10]

**Explanation:**

(2*(3-(4*5))) = -34 

((2*3)-(4*5)) = -14 

((2*(3-4))*5) = -10 

(2*((3-4)*5)) = -10 

(((2*3)-4)*5) = 10

## Solution
Use recursion. The base case is that the input does not contain any operator, where the input is converted into an integer and added into the result list, and the result list is returned.

Loop over the input string. If an operator is met, then divide the input string into two parts using the operator, call the method on both parts to obtain the results respectively, and calculate the final results using the results of both parts and the operator.
