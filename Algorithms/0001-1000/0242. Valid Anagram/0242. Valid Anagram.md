# 242. Valid Anagram
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two strings *s* and *t*, write a function to determine if *t* is an anagram of *s*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** *s* = "anagram", *t* = "nagaram"

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** *s* = "rat", *t* = "car"

**Output:** false

**Note:**

You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

**Follow up:**

What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

## Solution
The anagram relation is symmetric, that is, if *t* is an anagram of *s*, then *s* is also an anagram of *t*, or *s* and *t* are anagrams of each other.

Two strings are anagrams of each other if and only if they contain exactly the same characters without considering the order of characters. That is, for each character, both strings contain the same number of this character. Therefore, just count the number of times each lowercase alphabet occurs in both strings. If all characters have the same number of times in both strings, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This solution can be adapted to the follow-up problem as well.
