# 245. Shortest Word Distance III
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a list of words and two words *word1* and *word2*, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

*word1 and word2* may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

**Input:** *word1* = "makes", *word2* = "coding"

**Output:** 1

**Input:** *word1* = "makes", *word2* = "makes"

**Output:** 3

**Note:**

You may assume that *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.

## Solution
This is a follow-up problem of problem 243, and the difference is that in this problem, the two words may be the same.

The solution is quite similar to problem 243, with a restriction that the shortest distance must be positive (can't be 0).
