# 247. Strobogrammatic Number II
## Level
Medium

## Description
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.

**Example:**

**Input:**  n = 2
**Output:** ["11","69","88","96"]

## Solution
Use recursion. If `n` equals 1, then simply return a list with `"0"`, `"1"`, and `"8"`. If `n` equals 2, then simply return a list with `"11"`, `"69"`, `"88"`, and `"96"`.

For `n` greater than 2, find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = `n - 2`, and append each digit among `"0"`, `"1"` or `"8"` at both the start and the end, or append a `"6"` at the start and a `"9"` at the end, or append a `"9"` at the start and a `"6"` at the end.

Finally remove the numbers that has length greater than 1 and starts with `"0"`.
