## Description
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...]` (s<sub>i</sub> < e<sub>i</sub>), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[7,10],[2,4]]

**Output:** 1

## Solution
First sort `intervals` by the start times and the end times. Then loop over `intervals` to determine the minimum number of meeting rooms. The first interval goes to the first meeting room. For each interval, obtain its start time and end time, check whether a new meeting room is required, and update the end time of the meeting room for this interval. Finally, return the number of meeting rooms.
