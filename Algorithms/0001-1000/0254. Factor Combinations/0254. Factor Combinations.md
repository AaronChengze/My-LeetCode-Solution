# 254. Factor Combinations
## Level
Medium

## Description
Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,
```
8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
```
Write a function that takes an integer *n* and return all possible combinations of its factors.

**Note:**

1. You may assume that *n* is always positive.
2. Factors should be greater than 1 and less than *n*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: []
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 37
Output:[]
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: 12
Output:
[
  [2, 6],
  [2, 2, 3],
  [3, 4]
]
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: 32
Output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [4, 8]
]
```

## Solution
Use backtrack. Initially the result list `factorsList` is empty. Create a list `temp` that stores integers, which is also empty initially. The backtrack method has three parameters, which are the number `n`, the result list `factorsList`, and the temp list `temp`.

In the backtrack method, if `n` is 1 and `temp` contains at least 2 elements, then create a list which is a copy of `temp`, and add the newly created array to the result list. The requirement that `temp` contains at least 2 elements can make sure that all factors are greater than 1, since any prime number can be only divisible by 1 and itself.

If `n` is greater than 1, then for each `i` such that `2 <= i <= n` and `n % i == 0`, if `i` is greater than the last element in `temp`, add `i` to `temp` call the backtrack method using parameters `n / i`, `factorsList` and `temp`, and remove `i` from `temp`.
