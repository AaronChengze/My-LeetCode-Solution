# 258. Add Digits
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a non-negative integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

**Example:**

**Input:** 38

**Output:** 2 

**Explanation:** The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

**Follow up:**

Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

## Solution
This problem can be solved using loop or recursion. However, a solution with O(1) time complexity also exists.

The result of adding all digits of a number is actually the remainder of the number mod 9, except when the number is divisible by 9. If the number `num` is 0, then return 0. If `num` is not divisible by 9, then return `num % 9`. If `num` is greater than 0 and divisible by 9, then return 9.
