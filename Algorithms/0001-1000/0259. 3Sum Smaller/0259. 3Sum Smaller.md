## Description
Given an array of *n* integers nums and a *target*, find the number of index triplets `i, j, k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], and target = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
             [-2,0,1]
             [-2,0,3]
```
**Follow up:** Could you solve it in O(*n*<sup>2</sup>) runtime?

## Solution
First, sort the array. Next, fix the middle number each time and find sums for all triplets, and update the counter each time a triplet with sum less than `target` is found.

Each time a middle index is fixed, use two pointers that initially point to indices adjacent to the middle and move then towards the two ends respectively.
