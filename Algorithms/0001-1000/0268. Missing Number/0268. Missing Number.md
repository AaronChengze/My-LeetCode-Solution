# 268. Missing Number
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array containing *n* distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,0,1]

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

**Output:** 8

**Note:**

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## Solution
The sum of integers in the sequence `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, which contains `n + 1` numbers, is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

Calculate the sum `sum` of the numbers in the array. Suppose the number `i` is missing in the array, then `sum` equals `n * (n + 1) / 2 - i`. Calculate `n * (n + 1) / 2 - sum` to find the missing number.
