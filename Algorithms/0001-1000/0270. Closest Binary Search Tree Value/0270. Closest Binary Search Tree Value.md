# 270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

**Note:**

* Given target value is a floating point.
* You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: 4
```

## Solution
Initialize the closest value as the root's value and the minimum difference as the absolute value of the difference between the root's value and the target value.

Try to find the target value in the tree. If a node's value equals the target value, then such a value is closest to the target since the difference is 0, so return the node's value. If a node's value is greater than the target value, search in the node's left subtree. If a node's value is less than the target value, search in the node's right subtree. Each time a node is visited, if absolute value of the difference between the current node's value and the target value is less than the minimum difference so far, then update the closest value and the minimum difference.

Finally, return the closest value.
