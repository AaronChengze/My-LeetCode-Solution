# 287. Find the Duplicate Number
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,3,4,2,2]

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,1,3,4,2]

**Output:** 3

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(*n*<sup>2</sup>).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Solution
According to pigeonhole principle, if *n* + 1 integers have *n* different values, then at least two integers have the same value, which means at least one duplicate number must exist.

Use the idea of binary search. Initialize `low` as 1 and `high` as *n*. Each time let `mid` be the average of `low` and `high`, and loop over the array `nums` to count the number of elements that are less than or equal to `mid`. If the number of elements less than or equal to `mid` does not exceed `mid`, then the duplicate number is greater than `mid`, so set `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, the duplicate number is less than or equal to `mid`, so set `high = mid`. Finally, `low` and `high` will become equal, and return the value of `low`.
