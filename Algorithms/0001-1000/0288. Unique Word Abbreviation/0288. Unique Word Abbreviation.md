## Description
An abbreviation of a word follows the form <first letter><number><last letter>. Below are some examples of word abbreviations:
```
a) it                      --> it    (no abbreviation)

     1
     ↓
b) d|o|g                   --> d1g

              1    1  1
     1---5----0----5--8
     ↓   ↓    ↓    ↓  ↓    
c) i|nternationalizatio|n  --> i18n

              1
     1---5----0
     ↓   ↓    ↓
d) l|ocalizatio|n          --> l10n
```
Assume you have a dictionary and given a word, find whether its abbreviation is unique in the dictionary. A word's abbreviation is unique if no other word from the dictionary has the same abbreviation.

**Example:**
```
Given dictionary = [ "deer", "door", "cake", "card" ]

isUnique("dear") -> false
isUnique("cart") -> true
isUnique("cane") -> false
isUnique("make") -> true
```

## Solution
Use a map to store each abbreviation and the words that have the abbreviation. In the constructor, for each word in `dictionary`, obtain its abbreviation, obtain the list of the words that have the abbreviation, and add the current word to the list. Each time the method `isUnique` is called, for the given word, obtain its abbreviation and the list of the words that have the abbreviation. Return `true` for the following 2 cases.

1. The list has size 0.
2. The list has size 1 and the word in the list is the same as the given list.

In other cases, return `false`.
