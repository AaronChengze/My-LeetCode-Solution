# 293. Flip Game
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip two **consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "++++"
Output: 
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
```
**Note:** If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.

## Solution
Loop over the string. If at an index `i` there are two consicutive `"++"`, add `i` to the indices list. For all the indices in the list, flip the two consecutive `"++"` to `"--"` to form a new string, and add the new string to the result list.
