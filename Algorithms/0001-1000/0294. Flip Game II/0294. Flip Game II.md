## Description
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip two **consecutive** `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

**Example:**

**Input:** s = "++++"

**Output:** true 

**Explanation:** The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

**Follow up:**

Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.

## Solution
Use a map to store the relations between a string and whether starting from the string will lead to winning. Use recursion to figure out the results of the following states, and the result of the current state can be obtained.
