# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

**Input:** [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

**Note:**

* There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
* Your algorithm should run in O(*n*<sup>2</sup>) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

## Solution
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, which has O(*n*<sup>2</sup>) time complexity.

Let `length` be the length the array `nums` and create an array `dp` with length `length`. Each element in `dp` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the subarray from 0 to the current index inclusively.

For each index `i`, to get `dp[i]`, compare `nums[i]` with each element before it. If an element at index `j` which is before `nums[i]` is less than `nums[i]`, namely, `nums[j] < nums[i]` where `j < i`, then update `dp[i]` to be the maximum between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. 

After all elements in `dp` are calculated, loop over `dp` to find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
