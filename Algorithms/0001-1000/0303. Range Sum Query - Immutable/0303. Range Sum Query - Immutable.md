# 303. Range Sum Query - Immutable
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer array *nums*, find the sum of the elements between indices *i* and *j* (*i* â‰¤ *j*), inclusive.

**Example:**
```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```

**Note:**
1. You may assume that the array does not change.
2. There are many calls to *sumRange* function.

## Solution
Since the *sumRange* function is called many times, it should be implemented in an efficient way. In the constructor, initialize an array `sums` such that `sums[i]` represents the sum of the subarray `nums[0..i]`, that is, `sum[i] = nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i]`. When *sumRange* is called given indices *i* and *j*, return `sums[j]` if `i == 0`, or otherwise return `sums[j] - sums[i - 1]`.
