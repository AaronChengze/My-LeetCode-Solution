# 311. Sparse Matrix Multiplication
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two [sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) **A** and **B**, return the result of **AB**.

You may assume that **A**'s column number is equal to **B**'s row number.

**Example:**
```
Input:

A = [
  [ 1, 0, 0],
  [-1, 0, 3]
]

B = [
  [ 7, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 1 ]
]

Output:

     |  1 0 0 |   | 7 0 0 |   |  7 0 0 |
AB = | -1 0 3 | x | 0 0 0 | = | -7 0 3 |
                  | 0 0 1 |
```

## Solution
This problem can be solved just using normal matrix multiplication. Since both matrices **A** and **B** are sparse, there may be many elements that are 0 in both matrices, so the multiplication can be optimized.

Each time one row from **A** and one column from **B** are taken to do multiplication. If the row from **A** are all 0 or the column from **B** are all 0, then the result of the current multiplication must be 0, so simply skip the current row and column combination and move to another combination.
