# 315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an integer array *nums* and you have to return a new *counts* array. The *counts* array has the property where `counts[i]` is the number of smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

**Input:** [5,2,6,1]

**Output:** [2,1,1,0]

**Explanation:**

To the right of 5 there are **2** smaller elements (2 and 1).

To the right of 2 there is only **1** smaller element (1).

To the right of 6 there is **1** smaller element (1).

To the right of 1 there is **0** smaller element.

## Solution
Several solutions exist for this problem. This solution uses binary search.

Loop over `nums` from right to left, and maintain a list that stores the numbers from `nums`. The numbers in the list are always sorted in ascending order.

Each time a number from `nums` is visited, find the index of the number in the list using binary search to find the leftmost index that it should be inserted, add the index to the result list, and insert the number into the list at the index. The indices are added to the result list in reversing order. Finally, return the result list.
