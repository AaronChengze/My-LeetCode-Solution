Medium

## Description
Write a function to generate the generalized abbreviations of a word. 

**Note:** The order of the output does not matter.

**Example:**
```
Input: "word"
Output:
["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2", "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
```

## Solution
If the given `word` has length *n*, then since each character can either be in the abbreviation state or in the original state, there are 2<sup>*n*</sup> possible abbreviations in total.

Create an array `isAbbr` of length `n` with type `boolean`, where `isAbbr[i]` represents whether the letter at index `i` in `word` is in the abbreviation state. Loop over all possible states of `isAbbr` and generate the abbreviations accordingly.

To generate an abbrevation from `word` using the current state of `isAbbr`, replace the characters that are in the abbreviation state to numbers. If there are consecutive indices that are in the abbreviation state, then merge the indices and use a number that represents the length of the consecutive indices that are in the abbreviation state.

Finally, return a list that contains all abbreviations.
