# 321. Create Maximum Number
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given two arrays of length `m` and `n` with digits `0-9` representing two numbers. Create the maximum number of length `k <= m + n` from digits of the two. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved. Return an array of the `k` digits.

**Note:** You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 5]
nums2 = [9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3]
k = 5
Output:
[9, 8, 6, 5, 3]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
nums1 = [6, 7]
nums2 = [6, 0, 4]
k = 5
Output:
[6, 7, 6, 0, 4]
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input:
nums1 = [3, 9]
nums2 = [8, 9]
k = 3
Output:
[9, 8, 9]
```

## Solution
For `i` from 0 to `k`, find the max subsequence of `i` digits in `nums1` and the max subsequence of `k - i` digits in `nums2`, where each subsequence has length at least 0. Then merge the two max subsequences to form a complete max subsequence.

To obtain the max subsequence of determined number of digits, use a monotonic stack, where the element at the bottom of the stack is the maximum element. Each time an element from the array is met, if the element at the top of the stack is less than the current element and there are remaining elements to be deleted, pop the element from the stack. Then push the current element into the stack.

To merge two max subsequences, each time compare the remaining parts of the two subsequences, and add the maximum element into the merged subsequence.
