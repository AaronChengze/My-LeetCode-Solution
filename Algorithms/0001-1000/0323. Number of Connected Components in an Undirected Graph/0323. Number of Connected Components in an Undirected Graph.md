# 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4 

Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output: 1
```
**Note:**
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in edges.

## Solution
For each connected component, start from one node and search the whole component will make all nodes in the component visited. So the solution is to do the search on each node that has not been visited.

Loop over all nodes. If an unvisited node is met, start from this node and search the connected nodes until all nodes in the component are visited. Mark all the nodes in the component as visited, and add the number of components by 1.

After all nodes are visited, return the number of components.
