# 325. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array *nums* and a target value *k*, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to *k*. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

**Note:**

The sum of the entire *nums* array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** *nums* = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], *k* = 3

**Output:** 4 

**Explanation:** The subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** *nums* = [-2, -1, 2, 1], *k* = 1

**Output:** 2 

**Explanation:** The subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest.

Can you do it in O(*n*) time?

## Solution
If `nums` has length 0, then return 0.

To solve this problem in O(*n*) time, use a map to store each subarray's sum and its last index, where each subarray's start index is 0. Loop over `nums` once. For each index `i`, add `nums[i]` to the sum `sum`, which is the sum of the subarray that ends in the current index. If the sum equals `k`, then the current maximum length is `i + 1`, so update the maximum length as `i + 1`. Otherwise, if the map contains the key `sum - k`, obtain the maximum possible length of a subarray that ends at `i` and has sum `k`, and update the maximum length. Finally, return the maximum length.
