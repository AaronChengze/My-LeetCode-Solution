# 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = 
[
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = 
[
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
```

## Solution
Use topological sort. For each cell in `matrix`, consider all its neighbors. For each neighbor, if the neighbor has a value greater than the current cell, then increase the outdegree of the current cell by 1.

Then do breadth first search starting from all cells with outdegree 0. For each visited cell, consider all its neighbors. For each neighbor, if the neighbor has a value less than the current cell, then decrease the neighbor's outdegree by 1. If the neighbor's outdegree becomes 0, then offer the neighbor to the queue and continue searching. Maintain the maximum length during the search. Finally, return the maximum length.
