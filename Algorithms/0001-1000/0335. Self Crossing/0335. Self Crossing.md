# 335. Self Crossing
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an array *x* of `n` positive numbers. You start at point `(0,0)` and moves `x[0]` metres to the north, then `x[1]` metres to the west, `x[2]` metres to the south, `x[3]` metres to the east and so on. In other words, after each move your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Write a one-pass algorithm with `O(1)` extra space to determine, if your path crosses itself, or not.

**Example 1:**
```
┌───┐
│   │
└───┼──>
    │

Input: [2,1,1,2]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
┌──────┐
│      │
│
│
└────────────>

Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```
**Example 3:**
```
┌───┐
│   │
└───┼>

Input: [1,1,1,1]
Output: true
```

## Solution
If there are only 3 lines, then the path does not cross itself.

The 4th line can only cross the 1st line. The 5th line can only cross the 1st line or the 2nd line. The 6th line can only cross the 1st line, the 2nd line and the 3rd line. The 7th line can only cross the 2nd line, the 3rd line and the 4th line (the 1st line is not considered since if there is a cross with the 1st line, then there must be a cross with the 2nd line as well).

Therefore, For `i > 6`, the `i`-th line can only cross the `i-5`-th line, the `i-4`-th line and the `i-3`-th line. Maintain a sliding window of size at most 6 to make extra space O(1). Each time a new line is introduced, only consider the last 6 moves and determine whether there is a cross. If a cross occurs, return `true`. If no cross occurs, return `false`.
