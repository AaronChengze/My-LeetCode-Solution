# 336. Palindrome Pairs
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a list of **unique** words, find all pairs of ***distinct*** indices `(i, j)` in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. `words[i] + words[j]` is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]

**Output:** [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]] 

**Explanation:** The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["bat","tab","cat"]

**Output:** [[0,1],[1,0]] 

**Explanation:** The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]

## Solution
Use trie. Create a trie using each word's reversed string from `words`. For each node, maintain its children, and maintain two lists, which are the word list and the suffix list.

Then loop over `words` to find palindrome pairs. At this time, each word in `words` are not reversed. For each word, if a suffix of the word is a palindrome and the corresponding node is the end of a word, then a palindrome pair exists and add the pair to the result list. If the end of a word is reached, then check the last node's suffix list and add the pairs to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
