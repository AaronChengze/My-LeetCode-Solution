# 339. Nested List Weight Sum
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,1],2,[1,1]]

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,[4,[6]]]

**Output:** 27

**Explanation:** One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.

## Solution
Use the idea of breadth first search. For each element, store its depth as well. If an element is an integer, multiply the integer by the depth and add the multiplied number to the sum. If an element is a list, then for each element in the list, offer them to the queue and store each elements' depth as the current depth plus 1.
