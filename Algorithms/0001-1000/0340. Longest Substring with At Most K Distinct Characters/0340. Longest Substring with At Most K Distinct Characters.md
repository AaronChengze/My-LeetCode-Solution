# 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most *k* distinct characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "eceba", k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** T is "ece" which its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aa", k = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Solution
If the length of string `s` is less than or equal to `k`, then simply return `s.length()` since there can't be more than `k` distinct characters in `s`.

Use a `Map` to store each character and its number of occurrences. Loop over the string `s` once from left to right, and use two pointers `start` and `end` to represent the start index and the end index of the current substring. For each character, increase its number of occurrences by 1 in the `Map` and move `end` one step forward. If at one step, the `Map` contains more than `k` keys, then the current substring contains more than `k` distinct characters, so decrease the number of occurrences of the character at index `start` by 1, and move `start` one step forward, and if the number of occurrences of a character becomes 0, then remove the character from the `Map`. The process is repeated until the `Map` contains no more than `k` keys. At each step, update the maximum length of the substring that has at most two distinct characters. Finally, return the maximum length.
