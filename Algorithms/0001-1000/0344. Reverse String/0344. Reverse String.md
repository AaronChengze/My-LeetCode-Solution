# 344. Reverse String
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["h","e","l","l","o"]

**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]

**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Solution
Use pointers `low` and `high` that point to 0 and `s.length - 1` initially. While `low < high`, swap the characters at indices `low` and `high`, then move both `low` and `high` toward the middle of the array by 1 step.
