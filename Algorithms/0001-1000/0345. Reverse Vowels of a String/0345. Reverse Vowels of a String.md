# 345. Reverse Vowels of a String
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "hello"

**Output: "holle"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "leetcode"

**Output:** "leotcede"

**Note:**

The vowels does not include the letter "y".

## Solution
Loop over the string and store the indices where the characters are vowels. Suppose there are `n` indices where the characters are vowels and the `n` indices are stored in a list `vowelIndices`. Use two pointers `low` and `high` that initially point to 0 and `vowelIndices.size() - 1`. Each time obtain the two indices `vowelIndices.get(low)` and `vowelIndices.get(high)`, swap the two characters at the two indices, and increase `low` by 1 step and decrease `high` by 1 step. Repeat the procedure while `low < high`. Finally, return the new string after reversing the vowels.
