# 346. Moving Average from Data Stream
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

**Example:**
```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

## Solution
Maintain a variable `capacity` that equals the window size, which means the maximum number of elements in the sliding window. Maintain a variable `size` to represent the actual number of integers in the sliding window, which is at most `capacity`. Maintain a variable `sum` to represent the sum of all integers in the sliding window. Use a queue to store the most recent numbers.

In the constructor, initialize `capacity` to the given size, `size` to 0, and `sum` to 0.

Each time the method `next` is called, offer the new element to the queue and add the new element to `sum`. Check whether `size` is less than `capacity`. If so, increase `size` by 1. Otherwise, do not change `size` and remove one element from the queue, with `sum` updated. After the operations, return `sum / size`.
