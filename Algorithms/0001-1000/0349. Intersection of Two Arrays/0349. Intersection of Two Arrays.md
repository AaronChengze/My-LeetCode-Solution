# 349. Intersection of Two Arrays
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]

**Output:** [2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]

**Output:** [9,4]

**Note:**

* Each element in the result must be unique.
* The result can be in any order.

## Solution
Since the result doesn't contain any duplicates, use a set to store the numbers. First loop over `nums1` and add each number to the set. The set contains unique numbers from `nums1`. Then loop over `nums2`. If a number in `nums2` is also in the set, then the number is in the intersection, so add the number to the intersection list. To avoid duplicates, each number can be added to the intersection list at most once. Finally, use an array to store all the numbers in the intersection list, and return the array.
