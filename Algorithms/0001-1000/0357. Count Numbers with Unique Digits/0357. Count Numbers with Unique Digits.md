## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **non-negative** integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ¡Ü x < 10<super>n</super>.

**Example:**

**Input:** 2

**Output:** 91

**Explanation:** The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ¡Ü x < 100, excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99

## Solution
If n equals 0, since 10<sup>0</sup> = 1, the only number that satisfies the requirement is 0, so return 1.

If n equals 1, then all 1-digit numbers satisfy the requirement, so return 10.

If n is greater than 1, consider how many n-digit numbers have all digits unique. The highest digit has 9 choices since 0 can't be the highest digit. The second highest digit has 9 choices. The third highest digit has 8 choices. This also applies for the following digits. Therefore, there are 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * ... * (11 - n) n-digit number that have all digits unique. Obviously, there are at most 10 different digits, so if n is greater than 10, there won't be such a n-digit number that with all digits unique.

For a given n, calculate the number of 1-digit numbers, the number of 2-digit numbers, up to the number of n-digit numbers that have all digits unique, and sum them up.
