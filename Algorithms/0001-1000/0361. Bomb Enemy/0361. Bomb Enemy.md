# 361. Bomb Enemy
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall `'W'`, an enemy `'E'` or empty `'0'` (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.

The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.

**Note:** You can only put the bomb at an empty cell.

**Example:**
```
Input: [["0","E","0","0"],["E","0","W","E"],["0","E","0","0"]]
Output: 3 
Explanation: For the given grid,

0 E 0 0 
E 0 W E 
0 E 0 0

Placing a bomb at (1,1) kills 3 enemies.
```

## Solution
Maintain a 2D array `counts` that has the same rows and columns as `grid`. Loop over each cell in `grid`. If a cell contains an enemy `'E'`, then starting from the cell, in all four directions update the empty cells' counts by 1. Note that only empty cells' counts are updated, and in each direction if the border or a wall `'W'` is met, stop searching further in this direction. The reason is that if an empty cell is reachable from an enemy, then putting a bomb at the empty cell will kill the enemy.

After all enemies are visited and the counts are updated, return the maximum count.
