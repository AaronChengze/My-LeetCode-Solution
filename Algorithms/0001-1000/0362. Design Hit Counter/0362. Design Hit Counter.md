# 362. Design Hit Counter
## Level
Medium

## Description
Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.

Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.

It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.

**Example:**
```
HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.
counter.hit(1);

// hit at timestamp 2.
counter.hit(2);

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
counter.getHits(4);

// hit at timestamp 300.
counter.hit(300);

// get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
counter.getHits(300);

// get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
counter.getHits(301);
```

**Follow up:**

What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?

## Solution
Use a list to store the timestamps at which each hit occurs. Each time `hit` is called, add the corresponding timestamp to the list.

For the method `getHits`, if the timestamp is less than or equal to 300 seconds, which is 5 minutes, simply return the number of hits stored in the list. If the timestamp is greater than 300 seconds, use binary search to find the index of the begin time (or if the begin time doesn't exist in the list, find the index where the begin time should be inserted), and return the number of elements from the index to the end.
