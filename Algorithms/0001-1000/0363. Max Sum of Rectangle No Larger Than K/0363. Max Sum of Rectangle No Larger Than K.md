# 363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a non-empty 2D matrix *matrix* and an integer *k*, find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than *k*.

**Example:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2

**Output:** 2 

**Explanation:** Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2, and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).

**Note:**

1. The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
2. What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?

## Solution
For each row in `matrix`, calculate each element's prefix sum, which equals the sum of all elements before the element plus the element itself.

Then for `left` and `right` from 0 to the maximum column minus 1, where `left <= right`, for `i` from 0 to the maximum row minus 1, calculate the sum of all elements in the rectangle. Use a tree set to store the previous sums, where 0 is added initially. Each time a row is added into the rectangle, the maximum sum that does not exceed `k` can be obtained, and the maximum sum can be updated. Finally, return the maximum sum.
