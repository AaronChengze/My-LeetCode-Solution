# 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
  
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
```

**Explanation:**

1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:
```
          1
         / 
        2          
```

2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
```
          1          
```

3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
```
          []         
```

## Solution
Use preorder traversal. In each preorder traversal, obtain the nodes that are leaves, add their value to the current list, and set the nodes to `null`, which means to set their parents' corresponding children to `null`. After the current preorder traversal, add the current list to the result list.

The last leaf is the root node. If at one step the tree only contains the root, then add the root's value to the last list, add the last list to the result list, and stop traversal.

Finally, return the result list.
