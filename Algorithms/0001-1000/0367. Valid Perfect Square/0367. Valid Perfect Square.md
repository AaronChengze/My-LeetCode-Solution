# 367. Valid Perfect Square
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a positive integer *num*, write a function which returns True if *num* is a perfect square else False.

Note: Do not use any built-in library function such as `sqrt`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 16

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 14

**Output:** false

## Solution
First consider simple cases. If *num* is a one-digit perfect square number, return `true`.

Use binary search. For *num* that is large enough, its square root can't exceed *num* / 2, so set `low` to 1 and `high` to *num* / 2 initially. Each time set `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high` and calculate the square of `mid`. If the square number equals *num*, return `true`. If the square number is greater than *num*, set `high = mid - 1` or otherwise set `low = mid + 1`. Repeat the process while `low <= high`. If no square root that is an integer is found, return `false`.
