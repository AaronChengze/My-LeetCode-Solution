# 369. Plus One Linked List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a non-negative integer represented as **non-empty** a singly linked list of digits, plus one to the integer.

You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

**Example:**

**Input:** [1,2,3]

**Output:** [1,2,4]

## Solution
Since the integer is only added by 1, the length of the sum may increase at most 1 digit.

The number one is added to the least significant digit. Use a stack to store the nodes that represent each digit. Add 1 to the last node's value. If the value of a node becomes 10, then add the carry value to higher digits until the carry no longer exists. If the length of the sum is increased (e.g. 99 + 1 = 100), then create a new node as the head of the sum linked list, with the correct value.

Finally, return the head of the sum linked list.
