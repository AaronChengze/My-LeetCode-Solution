# 370. Range Addition

## Description
Assume you have an array of length ***n*** initialized with all **0**'s and are given ***k*** update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: **[startIndex, endIndex, inc]** which increments each element of subarray **A[startIndex ... endIndex]** (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with **inc**.

Return the modified array after all ***k*** operations were executed.

**Example:**

**Input:** length = 5, updates = [[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]]

**Output:** [-2,0,3,5,3]

**Explanation:**
```
Initial state:
[0,0,0,0,0]

After applying operation [1,3,2]:
[0,2,2,2,0]

After applying operation [2,4,3]:
[0,2,5,5,3]

After applying operation [0,2,-2]:
[-2,0,3,5,3]
```

## Solution
A triplet `[startIndex, endIndex, inc]` means that in the array, numbers from `startIndex` to `endIndex` inclusive are increased by `inc`. This can be solved in another way, which is only consider the margins of the range. Adding the number at `startIndex` in the array by `inc` causes all the numbers from `startIndex` to the end in the array to be increased by `inc`, and subtracting `inc` from the number at `endIndex + 1` in the array causes all the numbers from `endIndex + 1` to the end in the array to be decreased by `inc`, so after the two operations, exactly the numbers from `startIndex` and `endIndex` inclusive in the array are increased by `inc`.

Therefore, for each `update` in `updates`, simply do the two operations at the margins of the range. Finally, update the array from left to right such that each element is increased by its previous element, and the updated array is the final answer.
