# 377. Combination Sum IV
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

**Example:**
```
nums = [1, 2, 3]

target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
```

**Follow up:**

What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?

How does it change the problem?

What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. For target 0, there is 1 way, which is not to take any number. For target `n`, if there is a number `m` in array `num` and `m` â‰¤ `n`, then for any combination that sums up to `n - m`, adding `m` to the combination will make the combination sum become `n`, so add the number of combinations for sum `n - m` to the number of combinations for sum `n`.
