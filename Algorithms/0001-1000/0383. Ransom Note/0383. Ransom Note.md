# 383. Ransom Note
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

**Note:**
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
```
canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true
```

## Solution
Since both strings contain only lowercase letters, and each letter in the magazine string can only be used once, a straightforward solution is to count the number of times for each letter in both the ransom note string and the magazine string.

The ransom note can be constructed from the magazines if and only if for all letters, the number of times for the letter in the magazine string is greater than or equal to the number of times for the letter in the ransom note string.
