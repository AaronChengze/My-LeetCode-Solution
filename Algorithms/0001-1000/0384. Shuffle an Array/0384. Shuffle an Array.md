# 384. Shuffle an Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Shuffle a set of numbers without duplicates.

Example:
```
// Init an array with set 1, 2, and 3.
int[] nums = {1,2,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result. Any permutation of [1,2,3] must equally likely to be returned.
solution.shuffle();

// Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3].
solution.reset();

// Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3].
solution.shuffle();
```

## Solution
To shuffle the array such that all permutations are equally likely to be returned, one solution is to keep the original array and do shuffle once the method is called.

Use an array to keep the original order of numbers. Also keep the length of the array. In the constructor, initialize the array and the length.

The `reset` method simply returns the original array.

The `shuffle` method creates a new array that copies the values from the original array, and do the shuffle on the new array. The shuffle works as follows. For each index `i` from `0` to `length - 1`, randomly select another index `randomIndex` which is uniformly selected from `0` to `length - 1`, and swap the numbers at index `i` and index `randomIndex`. Since by random selecting an index, each index has the same probability to be selected, so all permutations are equally likely to be returned.
