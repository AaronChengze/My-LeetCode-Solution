# 386. Lexicographical Numbers
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer *n*, return 1 - *n* in lexicographical order.

For example, given 13, return: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

Please optimize your algorithm to use less time and space. The input size may be as large as 5,000,000.

## Solution
Obviously, the first number in lexicographical order is 1. Consider the next number after each number and repeat the process for *n* times.

Suppose the previous number is `num`. First consider `num * 10`, which means appending a zero after `num`, and this number is guaranteed to be the next lexicographically smallest number if it is not greater than `n`. If `num * 10` is greater than `n`, then set `num = num / 10` if `num >= n`. Increase `num` by 1 and remove all trailing zeros of `num`. After these operations, `num` is the next lexicalgraphically smallest number.
