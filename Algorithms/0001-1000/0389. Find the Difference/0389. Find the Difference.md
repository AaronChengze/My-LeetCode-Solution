# 389. Find the Difference
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two strings ***s*** and ***t*** which consist of only lowercase letters.

String ***t*** is generated by random shuffling string ***s*** and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in ***t***.

**Example:**
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

## Solution
Shuffling a string doesn't change the number of occurrences of each letter, and adding one more letter changes only the number of occurrences of the added letter, no matter at which position the letter is added.

Count each letter's number of occurrences in both ***s*** and ***t***. If a letter's number of occurrences is different in ***s*** and ***t***, then the letter is added to ***t*** and return the letter.
