# 391. Perfect Rectangle
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N > 0, determine if they all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point. For example, a unit square is represented as [1,1,2,2]. (coordinate of bottom-left point is (1, 1) and top-right point is (2, 2)).

**Example 1:**
```
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [3,2,4,4],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [2,3,3,4]
]

Return true. All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

**Example 2:**
```
rectangles = [
  [1,1,2,3],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [3,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.

**Example 3:**
```
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [3,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because there is a gap in the top center.

**Example 4:**
```
rectangles = [
  [1,1,3,3],
  [3,1,4,2],
  [1,3,2,4],
  [2,2,4,4]
]

Return false. Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.

## Solution
Each rectangle has 4 corners. If the rectangles can cover a rectangular region, then the following requirements must be met.
1. The sum of all rectangles' areas must be equal to the area of the rectangular region.
2. Only the 4 corners of the rectangular region appear exactly once. All other corners must appear twice or four times.

Use a set to store each rectangle's 4 corners. If a corner occurs an odd number of times, it is added into the set. If a corner occurs an even number of times, it is removed from the set.

If the set's size is not 4, or not all the rectangular region's corners are in the set, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true` if and only if the sum of all rectangles' areas must be equal to the area of the rectangular region.
