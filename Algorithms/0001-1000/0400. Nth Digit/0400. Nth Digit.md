## Description
Find the *n*<sup>th</sup> digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

**Note:**

*n* is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (*n* < 2<sup>31</sup>).

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

3

**Output:**

3

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

11

**Output:**

0

**Explanation:**

The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

## Solution
If *n* is less than or equal to 9, then all the numbers are one-digit number, so return *n*.

Consider the integer sequence. The count of 1-digit numbers is 9. The count of 2-digit numbers is 90. The count of 3-digit numbers is 900. Use this pattern to find the *n*<sup>th</sup> digit.

To avoid overflow, use data type `long`. Let `nLong` be equal to `n` but `nLong` has data type `long`.

For each digit length *k*, the count of *k*-digit numbers is 9×10<sup>*k*</sup>. For the remaining `nLong`, if it is greater than or equal to *k*×9×10<sup>*k*</sup>, then subtract *k*×9×10<sup>*k*</sup> from `nLong`, and increase *k* by 1 and repeat the procedure. If the remaining `nLong` becomes 0, then return 9 since the last digit of the greatest *k*-digit number is always 9. If `nLong` is less than the next *k*×9×10<sup>*k*</sup>, then find the number and the digit that the *n*<sup>th</sup> digit is in, and return the result.
