# 404. Sum of Left Leaves
## Level
Easy

## Description
Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

**Example:**
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.
```

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Each time a node is visited, check whether its left child is a leaf. If so, add the left child's value to the sum.

A node's left child is a leaf if and only if the left child is not `null` and the left child's both children are `null`.
