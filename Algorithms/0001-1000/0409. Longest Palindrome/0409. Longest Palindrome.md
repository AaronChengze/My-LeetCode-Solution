# 409. Longest Palindrome
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Note:**

Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

**Example:**
```
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

## Solution
In a palindrome, all letters occur even numbers of times, except the middle letter if the palindrome's length is odd.

Count each letter's count in string `s`, and for each letter, add the maximum even number that is not greater than the letter's count to the length of the longest palindrome. If at least one letter's count is odd, then one more character can be added at the center, so add 1 to the length of the longest palindrome. Finally, return the maximum possible length.
