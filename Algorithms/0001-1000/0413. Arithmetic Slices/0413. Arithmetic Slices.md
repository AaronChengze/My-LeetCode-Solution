## Description
A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```
The following sequence is not arithmetic.
```
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
```

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.

**Example:**
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
```

## Solution
A slice of the array is a subarray of the array, which requires that the elements are consecutive in the array. Loop over the array and find the longest possible arithmetic slice starting from each index. After the start indices and the end indices of all longest arithmetic slices are found, the number of arithmetic slices can be calculated. For a longest arithmetic slice with length `n` (which means there are `n + 1` numbers in the longest arithmetic slice), the number of arithmetic slices in the longest arithmetic slice is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. Return the total number of arithmetic slices.
