# 415. Add Strings
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

**Note:**

1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 5100.
2. Both `num1` and `num2` contains only digits `0-9`.
3. Both `num1` and `num2` does not contain any leading zero.
4. You **must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer** directly.

## Solution
First append zeros to the front of `num1` or `num2` to make the two integers have the same length. Then do the addition from the rightmost digit to the leftmost digit. If the sum is greater than or equal to 10, add the carry value to the higher digit.

After the sum is calculated, remove leading zeroes and return the sum as a string.
