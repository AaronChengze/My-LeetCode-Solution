# 421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **non-empty** array of numbers, a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, … , a<sub>n-1</sub>, where 0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> < 2<sup>31</sup>.

Find the maximum result of ai XOR aj, where 0 ≤ *i*, *j* < *n*.

Could you do this in O(*n*) runtime?

**Example:**

**Input:** [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]

**Output:** 28

**Explanation:** The maximum result is **5** ^ **25** = 28.

## Solution
For the 32 bits, maintain the mask from the highest bit to the lowest bit. Initially, `mask` is 0. For `i` from 31 to 0, set `mask |= (1 << i)`, and use `mask` to obtain all possible prefixes for the highest bits that are visited. If it is possible to obtain a 1 at the current bit, then the current bit of the XOR result is 1, which can make the XOR result maximum for the bits that have already been visited. Finally, after all the bits are visited, return the maximum XOR result.
