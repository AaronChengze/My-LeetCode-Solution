# 422. Valid Word Square
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a sequence of words, check whether it forms a valid word square.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the *k*<sup>th</sup> row and column read the exact same string, where 0 ≤ *k* < max(numRows, numColumns).

**Note:**
1. The number of words given is at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
2. Word length will be at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
3. Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet `a-z`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
[
  "abcd",
  "bnrt",
  "crmy",
  "dtye"
]

Output:
true

Explanation:
The first row and first column both read "abcd".
The second row and second column both read "bnrt".
The third row and third column both read "crmy".
The fourth row and fourth column both read "dtye".

Therefore, it is a valid word square.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
[
  "abcd",
  "bnrt",
  "crm",
  "dt"
]

Output:
true

Explanation:
The first row and first column both read "abcd".
The second row and second column both read "bnrt".
The third row and third column both read "crm".
The fourth row and fourth column both read "dt".

Therefore, it is a valid word square.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input:
[
  "ball",
  "area",
  "read",
  "lady"
]

Output:
false

Explanation:
The third row reads "read" while the third column reads "lead".

Therefore, it is NOT a valid word square.
```

## Solution
Check whether the given words form a symmetric word square. For row `i` and column `j` (the indices are all zero-based), which represents the letter at index `j` of word `i`, there should be a same letter at row `j` and column `i`. If row `j` and column `i` doesn't exist, or any word's length is greater than total rows (equivalently the number of words), or the letters at corresponding positions are different, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.
