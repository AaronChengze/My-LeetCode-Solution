# 431. Encode N-ary Tree to Binary Tree
## Level
Hard

## Description
Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See following example).*

For example, you may encode the following `3-ary` tree to a binary tree in this way:

**Input:** root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

Note that the above is just an example which *might or might not work*. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Constraints:**

* The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
* The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`
* Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.

## Solution
1. Encoding

Suppose a node in the N-ary tree has k children where 1 <= k <= N (if a node has 0 children, then it is a leaf and need not be considered), if it is converted into a binary tree node, then the corresponding binary tree node has a left child, which corresponds to the first child of the N-ary tree node, the left child of the binary tree node has a right child, which corresponds to the second child of the N-ary tree node. For the remaining children, the corresponding nodes in the binary tree are right children of the previous child.

In brief, the left child in the binary tree corresponds to the first child in the N-ary tree, and the right child in the binary tree corresponds to the next sibling in the N-ary tree.

For implementation, use a map to store each N-ary tree node and the corresponding binary tree node, where the two roots are put into the map initially. Do breadth first search on the N-ary tree node starting from the root. Each time an N-ary tree node is met, obtain the corresponding binary tree node, obtain all the N-ary tree node's children, create a left child for the binary tree node using the first child's value, and create right children for the left child and the right children using the remaining children's values.

2. Decoding

After encoding, the binary tree's root may have a left child, but it may never have a right child, since the root does not have any sibling. The idea is quite straightforward. For each node in the binary tree, its left child has the node as the parent in the N-ary tree, and its right child has the node's parent as the parent in the N-ary tree.

For implementation, use a map to store each binary tree node and the corresponding N-ary tree node, where the two roots are put into the map initially. Do breadth first search on the binary tree node starting from the root. Each time a binary tree node is met, obtain the corresponding N-ary tree node, obtain the binary tree node's left child and right child, create children nodes that are N-ary tree nodes accordingly. Also use another map to store each N-ary tree node and the corresponding parent. Each time a left child of the binary tree node is met, update the corresponding N-ary tree node's parent in the second map, and add the child to the parent's children list. Each time a right child of the binary tree node is met, obtain its previous sibling of the N-ary tree node and obtain its parent, and add the child to the parent's children list.
