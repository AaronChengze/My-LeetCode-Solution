# 437. Path Sum III
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

**Example:**
```
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

## Solution
If root is `null`, then return 0 since there is no such a path.
If root is not `null`, use recursion.
If root's value equals `sum`, then there is one path that contains only one node.
After considering the root's value only, consider the root's children, where the sum applied for each child is `sum - root.val`.
