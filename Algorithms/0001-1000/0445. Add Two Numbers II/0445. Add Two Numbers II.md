# 445. Add Two Numbers II
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Follow up:**

What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.

**Example:**

**Input:** (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)

**Output:** 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7

## Solution
Create a new list (with type `ListNode`) to store the sum of the two lists. Since the most significant digit comes first, use two stacks to store the nodes of the two lists, with the least significant digit at the top of the two stacks.

For the sum, also use a stack to store the nodes, with the most significant digit at the top of the stack. Each time calculate a node in the sum. If the stack is not empty, then the current node's next points the top node of the stack. Push the current node into the stack. If there is a carry value, keep the carry value to the next more significant digit.

Finally, return the node at the top of the sum stack.
