# 447. Number of Boomerangs
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given *n* points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k` (**the order of the tuple matters**).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that *n* will be at most **500** and coordinates of points are all in the range **[-10000, 10000]** (inclusive).

**Example:**

**Input:**
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

**Output:**
2

**Explanation:**
The two boomerangs are **[[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]]** and **[[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]**

## Solution
For each `point` in `points`, calculate the distance of any other `point` to the current `point`, and store the number of `point`s for each distance. For each distance, if there are `k` points, then there are `k * (k - 1)` boomerangs for the current `point`. Calculate the sum to obtain the total number of boomerangs.
