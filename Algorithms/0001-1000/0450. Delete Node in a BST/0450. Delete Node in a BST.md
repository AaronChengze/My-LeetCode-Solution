# 450. Delete Node in a BST
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

**Note:** Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

**Example:**
```
root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7
```

## Solution
If `root` is `null`, return `root`.

If `root.val == key`, consider the following cases.
1. The root has a right child. Find the root's successor in its right subtree. If the root's right child does not have a left child, then the root's right child is the root's successor. Simply set the root's right child to be the new root and set the new root's left child to be the previous root's left child. If the root's right child has a left child, then find the root's successor, update the root's value with the successor's value and set the node which previously had the value of the successor to `null`.
2. The root doesn't have a right child. Set the root to be its left child.

If `key` does not equal `root.val`, then find the node with value `key` in the binary search tree and do the deletion similar to the procedure above.
