# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
"tree"

**Output:**
"eert"

**Explanation:**
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
"cccaaa"

**Output:**
"cccaaa"

**Explanation:**
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

**Example 3:**

**Input:**
"Aabb"

**Output:**
"bbAa"

**Explanation:**
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

## Solution
Since the string needs to be sorted in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, the number of times each character appear must be counted. Loop over the string to get the number of times of each character. Next, sort the characters based on the number of times in decreasing order. Finally, create a new string, where the characters are added to the string from the most frequent character to the least frequent character.
