# 466. Count The Repetitions

## Description
Define `S = [s,n]` as the string S which consists of n connected strings s. For example, `["abc", 3]` = "abcabcabc".

On the other hand, we define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1. For example, "abc" can be obtained from "abdbec" based on our definition, but it can not be obtained from “acbbe”.

You are given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 (each at most 100 characters long) and two integers 0 ≤ n1 ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> and 1 ≤ n2 ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>. Now consider the strings S1 and S2, where `S1=[s1,n1]` and `S2=[s2,n2]`. Find the maximum integer M such that `[S2,M]` can be obtained from `S1`.

**Example:**
```
Input:
s1="acb", n1=4
s2="ab", n2=2

Return:
2
```

## Solution
Calculate the greatest common divisor of `n1` and `n2`, and divide both `n1` and `n2` by the greatest common divisor. Then loop over both `s1` and `s2` to find the repetition part. If at the end of one loop over `s1`, the index in `s2` is the same as a previous index, then a repetition is found, so calculate the maximum `M` using the previous count, the pattern count and the remaining count. If no repetition is found, return the count at index `n1 - 1` divided by `n2`.
