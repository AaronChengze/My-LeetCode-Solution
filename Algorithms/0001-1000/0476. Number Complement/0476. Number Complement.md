# 476. Number Complement
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Note:**
1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer's binary representation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 1

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

## Solution
For a positive integer, if it is represented by *n* bits such that the highest bit is 1, then the sum of the positive integer and its complement number equals 2<sup>*n*</sup>-1. So the solution is to obtain the given positive integer's number of digits, and its complement number can be obtained.
