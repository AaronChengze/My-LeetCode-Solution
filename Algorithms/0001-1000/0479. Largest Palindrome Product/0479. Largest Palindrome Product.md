# 479. Largest Palindrome Product
## Level
Hard

## Description
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.

Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.

**Example:**

Input: 2

Output: 987

Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987

**Note:**

The range of n is [1,8].

## Solution
If `n` is 1, return 9. For `n` greater than 1, the maximum n-digit number is 10^n - 1. For each n-digit number, create a palindrome that has 2 * n digits and check whether there exists an n-digit number that is greater than or equal to the palindrome's square root and can divide the palindrome completely. If such an n-digit number is found, return the palindrome mod 1337.
