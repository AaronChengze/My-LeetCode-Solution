# 483. Smallest Good Base
## Level
Hard

## Description
For an integer n, we call k>=2 a ***good base*** of n, if all digits of n base k are 1.

Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good base of n in string format.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "13"

**Output:** "3"

**Explanation:** 13 base 3 is 111.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "4681"

**Output:** "8"

**Explanation:** 4681 base 8 is 11111.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "1000000000000000000"

**Output:** "999999999999999999"

**Explanation:** 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.

**Note:**

1. The range of n is [3, 10^18].
2. The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.

## Solution
The integer `n` can be represented using data type `long`, which is `num`. This problem is equivalent to finding the maximum integer `m` such that `num = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m`. After `m` is determined, `k` is the smallest good base. Obviously, `m` cannot exceed `Math.log(num) / Math.log(2)`. Loop over `m` from the maximum possible value to 2. For each `m`, if there exists such a `k`, then return `k` as a string. Otherwise, return `num - 1` as a string, which is always a good base (although not necessarily the smallest good base).
