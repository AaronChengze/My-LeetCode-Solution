## Description
You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols `+` and `-`. For each integer, you should choose one from `+` and `-` as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
```

**Note:**
1. The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
2. The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
3. Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

## Solution
First calculate the sum of all the elements in `nums`, which is `sum`. Then calculate `difference = sum - S`. If `difference` is negative or odd, then it is impossible to add symbols to make the result equal to `S`, so return 0.

Let `maxValue = difference / 2`. The problem is converted to finding some numbers from `nums` such that these numbers sum up to `difference`. Choose `-` for these numbers and choose `+` for the rest of the numbers, and the result equals `S`.

Use dynamic programming. Create an array `dp` of length `maxValue + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to make the result equal to `i`. Initialize `dp[0] = 1` since not selecting any number will have sum 0, which counts as 1 way. For each `num` in `nums`, for `i` from `maxValue` to `num` where `i` is decreased by 1 each time, update `dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i - num]`. This means that suppose the sum `i - num` has been reached (which means the numbers with symbol `-` sum up to `i - num`), then selecting the number `num` will lead to sum `i`, so add `dp[i - num]` to `dp[i]`. Finally, return `dp[maxValue]`.
