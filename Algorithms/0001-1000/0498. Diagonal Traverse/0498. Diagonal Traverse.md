**Note:**

The total number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.

## Solution
The most difficult point is to determine which is the next element. If a border of the matrix is met, then the next element is always to the down or to the right. Consider the cases where each border is met and obtain the next element accordingly.
