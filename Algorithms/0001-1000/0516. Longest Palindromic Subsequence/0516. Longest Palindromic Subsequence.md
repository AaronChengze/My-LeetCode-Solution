# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
"bbbab"
```
Output:
```
4
```
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

**Example 2:**

Input:
```
"cbbd"
```
Output:
```
2
```
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let `length` be the length of string `s`. Create a 2D array `dp` with `length` rows and `length` columns, where `dp[i][j]`represents the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s` from index `i` to index `j` inclusive if `i <= j`. For `i > j`, `dp[i][j]` is 0.

Initialize `dp[i][i] = 0` for all `0 <= i < length`. Loop over `i` from `length - 1` to 0. For each `i`, loop over `j` from `i + 1` to `length`, and update `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2` if `s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)` or `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]` otherwise.

Finally, return `dp[0][length - 1]`.
