# 520. Detect Capital
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

1. All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
2. All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
3. Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".

Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "USA"

**Output:** True

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "FlaG"

**Output:** False

**Note:** The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.

## Solution
If `word` has length 1, then return `true` since it always uses capitals in a right way.

Check whether the first letter is a capital. If the first letter is a capital, check the other letters. The other letters should be all capicals or none of the other letters should be a capital. If violated, return `false`.

If the first letter is not a capital, then none of the other letters should be a capital. If a capital is found, return `false`.

Finally, if none of the cases is violated, return `true`.
