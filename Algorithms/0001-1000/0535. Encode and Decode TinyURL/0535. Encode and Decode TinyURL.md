# 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL
## Level

## Description
> Note: This is a companion problem to the [System Design](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/) problem: [Design TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/).

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

## Solution
Use a map to store each encoded short URL and the corresponding long URL before encoding. Maintain a counter `count` that represents the number of URLs that have been encoded, which is initially 0.

Each time `encode` is called, increase `count` by 1, and create the short URL as `"http://tinyurl.com/" + count`. Map the short URL to the original long URL, and the key-value pair (the key is the short URL and the value is the long URL) is stored in the map.

Each time `decode` is called, simply obtain the long URL from the map using the short URL as the key.
