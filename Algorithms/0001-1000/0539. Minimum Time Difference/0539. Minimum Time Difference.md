# 539. Minimum Time Difference
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum **minutes** difference between any two time points in the list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["23:59","00:00"]

**Output:** 1

**Note:**
1. The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
2. The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.

## Solution
Sort the list `timePoints`. For each pair of adjacent time points (including the first and the last after sorting), calculate the difference between the two time points. If the difference calculated by subtracting the smaller time point from the large time point is `m` minutes, then the minimum time difference between the two time points is `Math.min(m, 1440 - m)`. Finally, return the minimum time difference among all time points.
