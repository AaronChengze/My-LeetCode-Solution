# 546. Remove Boxes
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers. 

You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get `k*k` points.

Find the maximum points you can get.

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
[1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
```
Output:
```
23
```
Explanation:
```
[1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points) 
----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [] (2*2=4 points)
```
**Note:** The number of boxes n would not exceed 100.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 3D array `dp` of size `n * n * n`, where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the maximum points that can be achieved in the subarray `boxes[i..j]` when there are `k` elements that are the same as the element at index `j` and after index `j`. The objective is to obtain the value `dp[0][n - 1][0]`.

To fill in `dp`, use a recursive method `getPoints` that contains `boxes`, `dp`, `i`, `j` and `k` as parameters. If `j > i` and `boxes[j] == boxes[j - 1]`, then reduce `j` until `i == j ` or `boxes[j] != boxes[j - 1]` and at the same time increase `k`. Then `dp[i][j][k] = dp[i][j - 1][0] + (k + 1) * (k + 1)`. Next loop over `m` from `i` to `j - 1`, and if `boxes[m] == boxes[i]`, update `dp[i][j][k]` as the maximum of `dp[i][m][k + 1] + dp[m + 1][j - 1][0]`.
