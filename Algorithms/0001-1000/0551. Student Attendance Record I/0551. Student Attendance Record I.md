# 551. Student Attendance Record I
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

1. **'A'** : Absent.
2. **'L'** : Late.
3. **'P'** : Present.

A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain **more than one 'A' (absent)** or **more than two continuous 'L' (late)**.

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "PPALLP"

**Output:** True

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "PPALLL"

**Output:** False

## Solution
If a student could be rewarded, the attendance record may contain at most one 'A' and at most two continuous 'L'. Check the attendance record from left to right. If at one point, there are two 'A', return `false`. If 'L' is met, add the counter for 'L' by 1. If the current letter is not 'L', then set the counter for 'L' to 0. If at one point, the counter for 'L' exceeds 2, return `false`. If the end of the attendance record is reached and the attendance record  doesn't contain more than one 'A' or more than two continuous 'L' , return `true`.
