# 605. Can Place Flowers
## Level
Easy

## Description
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number **n**, return if **n** new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1

**Output:** True

**Example 2:**

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2

**Output:** False

**Note:**
1. The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
2. The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
3. **n** is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

## Solution
For each subarray that contains 0 only, obtain the length of the subarray and calculate the maximum number of new flowers that can be planted in the subarray. The new flowers planted must not be adjacent to each other or to the flowers that already exist. Finally return whether the maximum possible number of new flowers in total is greater than or equal to `n`.
