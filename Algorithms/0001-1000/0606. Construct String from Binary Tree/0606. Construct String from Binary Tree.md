# 606. Construct String from Binary Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.

The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /    
  4     

Output: "1(2(4))(3)"

Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", 
but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. 
And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 

Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"

Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, 
except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
```

## Solution
Use the idea of depth first search. Use a stack to store the nodes to be visited, and use a set to store the nodes that have already been visited. Initially the stack contains the root. Each time obtain the node at the top of the stack (including the root), if the node hasn't been visited, then add a left parenthesis to the string and add the node's value to the string, then obtain the node's two children. If the left child is `null` and the right child is not `null`, then add a pair of empty parentheses to the string. Push the right child and then the left child into the stack, if the child is not `null`. If the node at the top of the stack has already been visited, pop the node and add a right parenthesis to the string.

Finally, remove the outmost pair of parenthesis, which is around the root. Return the string.
