# 628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3]

**Output: 6**

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 24

**Note:**

1. The length of the given array will be in range [3,10<sup>4</sup>] and all elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].
2. Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.

## Solution
Use three lists to store the numbers in `nums` in three categories, which are zeroes, positive integers and negative integers.

If it is possible to obtain a positive product, then consider the maximum possible positive product. The three integer may be all positive, or one positive integer and two negative integers.

If it is impossible to obtain a positive product, then check whether there are zeroes. If there exists at least one 0, since 0 is greater than any negative integer, return 0.

Otherwise, the product must be negative, so return the product with the minimum absolute value.
