# 629. K Inverse Pairs Array
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given two integers `n` and `k`, find how many different arrays consist of numbers from `1` to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs.

We define an inverse pair as following: For `i-th` and `j-th` element in the array, if `i` < `j` and `a[i]` > `a[j]` then it's an inverse pair; Otherwise, it's not.

Since the answer may be very large, the answer should be modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 0

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pair.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.

**Note:**

1. The integer `n` is in the range [1, 1000] and `k` is in the range [0, 1000].

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `n + 1` rows and `k + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of different arrays consist of numbers from 1 to `i` such that there are exactly `j` inverse pairs. Let `dp[i][j] = 0` if `j < 0`, and let `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `1 <= i <= n`.

For `dp[i][j]`, the value can be obtained by calculating the sum of elements from `dp[i - 1][j - i + 1]` to `dp[i - 1][j]`, since the number `i` can be inserted at any of the `i` positions in the permutation of 1 to `i - 1` (including the start and the end). It can be further concluded that `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1]`. Finally, return `dp[n][k]`.
