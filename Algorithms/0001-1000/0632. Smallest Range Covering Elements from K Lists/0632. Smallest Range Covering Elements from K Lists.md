# 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists
## Level
Hard

## Description
You have `k` lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the **smallest** range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if `b-a < d-c` or `a < c` if `b-a == d-c`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]

**Output:** [20,24]

**Explanation:**

List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].

List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].

List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].

**Note:**

1. The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
2. 1 <= `k` <= 3500
3. -10<sup>5</sup> <= `value of elements` <= 10<sup>5</sup>.

## Solution
Create an array `next` that represents the current indices of each list.

Use a priority queue to store the numbers from 0 to `k - 1`. The element `i` is polled from the priority queue first if `nums.get(i).get(next[i])` is the smallest among all the values in the priority queue. Loop over `nums` and initialize `max` as the maximum value among all lists' first elements.

Then loop over the `k` lists. Each time obtain the minimum element from the priority queue and calculate the current range, and update the smallest range. Then update the corresponding index in `next` and offer the element back to the priority queue.

Finally, return the smallest range.
