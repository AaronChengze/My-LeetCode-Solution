# 633. Sum of Square Numbers
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a non-negative integer `c`, your task is to decide whether there're two integers `a` and `b` such that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 5

**Output:** True

**Explanation:* 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 3

**Output:** False

## Solution
Maintain two numbers `low` and `high`, which are 0 and the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of `c`. While `low < high`, calculate `sum = low * low + high * high`. If `sum == c`, then the two integers are found, so return `true`. If `sum > c`, then `sum` is too large, so decrease `high` by 1. If `sum < c`, then `sum` is too small, so increase `low` by 1. If the two integers can't be found, return `false`.
