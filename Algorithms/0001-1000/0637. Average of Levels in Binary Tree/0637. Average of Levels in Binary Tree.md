# 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
Explanation:
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
```
**Note:**
1. The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Each time all the nodes in the same level are visited, so obtain the number of nodes in each level and calculate the sum of values in each node, and the average values can be calculated.
