# 644. Maximum Average Subarray II
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array consisting of `n` integers, find the contiguous subarray whose **length is greater than or equal to** `k` that has the maximum average value. And you need to output the maximum average value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4

**Output:** 12.75

**Explanation:**

When length is 5, maximum average value is 10.8,

When length is 6, maximum average value is 9.16667.

Thus return 12.75.

**Note:**
1. 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10,000.
2. Elements of the given array will be in range [-10,000, 10,000].
3. The answer with the calculation error less than 10<sup>-5</sup> will be accepted.

## Solution
Use binary search. Initialize `min` and `max` to be the minimum element in `nums` and the maximum element in `nums`, respectively. Each time calculate `mid` as the average of `min` and `max`, and maintain `prevMid` which stores the previous value of `mid`. After `mid` is calculated, check whether there exists a subarray of `nums` such that its average value is at least `mid`. If so, set `min = mid`. Otherwise, set `max = mid`. Then calculate the error as the absolute difference between `mid` and `prevMid` and set `prevMid = mid`. The binary search ends when the error does not exceed 10^-5. Finally, return `min`.
