# 648. Replace Words

## Description
In English, we have a concept called `root`, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word `successor`. For example, the root `an`, followed by `other`, which can form another word `another`.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the `successor` in the sentence with the `root` forming it. If a `successor` has many `roots` can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]

sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"

**Output:** "the cat was rat by the bat"

**Note:**

1. The input will only have lower-case letters.
2. 1 <= dict words number <= 1000
3. 1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
4. 1 <= root length <= 100
5. 1 <= sentence words length <= 1000

## Solution
Use a trie that stores all the roots from `dict`. Split `sentence` into an array of words. For each word in the array, find whether there exists a root of the word. If one or more roots exist, use the shortest root to replace the word. If no root is found, then keep the original word.

Finally, return the sentence after the replacement.
