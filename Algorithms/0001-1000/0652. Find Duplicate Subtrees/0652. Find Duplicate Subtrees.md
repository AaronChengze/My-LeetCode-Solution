# 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any **one** of them.

Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.

**Example 1:**
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   2   4
       /
      4
```
The following are two duplicate subtrees:
```
      2
     /
    4
```
and
```
    4
```
Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.

## Solution
Use breadth first search and serialization. For each node, obtain the subtree with the node as the root, and do serialization that contains all the nodes' values in the order of breadth first search, including `null` values. The serialization result is a string. Since `null` values are included, the serialization result for each tree is unique.

If a subtree's serialization already exists, then the subtree is a duplicate subtree. Also make sure that each duplicate subtree only occurs once in the result list.

Finally, return the result list.
