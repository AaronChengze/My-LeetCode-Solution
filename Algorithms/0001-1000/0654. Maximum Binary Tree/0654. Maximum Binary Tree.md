# 654. Maximum Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:

1. The root is the maximum number in the array.
2. The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
3. The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.

Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

      6
    /   \
   3     5
    \    / 
     2  0   
       \
        1
```

**Note:**
1. The size of the given array will be in the range [1,1000].

## Solution
Loop over `nums` from left to right once. Use a stack to store nodes.

For each `num` in `nums`, create a new node with value `num`. If the stack contains nodes and the node at the top of the stack has value less than `num`, then pop the stack. If the stack is empty, push the new node into the stack. Otherwise, obtain the node at the top of the stack and set its right child to be the new node and push the new node into the stack. Set the new node's left child to be the last node popped from the stack.

Finally, pop the stack until the last element in the stack is reached. The last element in the stack is the root of the maximum binary tree.
