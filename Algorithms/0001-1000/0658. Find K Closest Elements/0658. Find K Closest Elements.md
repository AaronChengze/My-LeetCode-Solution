# 658. Find K Closest Elements
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a sorted array, two integers `k` and `x`, find the `k` closest elements to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=3

**Output:** [1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,5], k=4, x=-1

**Output:** [1,2,3,4]

**Note:**
1. The value k is positive and will always be smaller than the length of the sorted array.
2. Length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.
3. Absolute value of elements in the array and x will not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.

## Solution
Use binary search to find the index of `x` in the array, or the index at which `x` should be inserted in the array. Then use two pointers `index1` and `index2` that point to numbers less than `x` and greater than `x` respectively to determine which numbers are closest to `x`. If both numbers have the same absolute difference to `x` or the number at `index1` has a smaller absolute difference, then add the number at `index1` to the result list and move `index1` to the left by 1 step. Otherwise, add the number at `index2` to the result list and move `index2` to the right by 1 step. If one pointer is out of the bound of the array, then only consider the other pointer. Repeat the process until `k` numbers are added to the result list. Finally, sort the result list and return.
