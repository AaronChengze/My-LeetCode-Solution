# 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `nums` sorted in ascending order, return `true` if and only if you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,3,4,5]

**Output:** True

**Explanation:**

You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 

1, 2, 3

3, 4, 5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]

**Output:** True

**Explanation:**

You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5

3, 4, 5

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,4,5]

**Output:** False

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10000`

## Solution
Use greedy algorithm. First count each number's number of occurrences in `nums`. Then for each `num` in `nums`, if it is the end of a subsequence (exclusive), then update the end count of `num` and the end count of `num + 1`. Otherwise, check whether `num + 1` and `num + 2` has numbers of occurrences greater than 0. If so, decrease their numbers of occurrences by 1 and update the end count for `num + 3`. Otherwise, return `false`. After the operations, decrease the number of occurrences of `num` by 1.

If no conflict is met, return `true`.
