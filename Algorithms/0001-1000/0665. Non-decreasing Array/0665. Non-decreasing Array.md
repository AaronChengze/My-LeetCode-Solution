# 665. Non-decreasing Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying **at most** `1` element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if `array[i] <= array[i + 1]` holds for every `i` (1 <= i < n).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [4,2,3]

**Output:** True

**Explanation:** You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [4,2,1]

**Output:** False

**Explanation:** You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.

**Note:** The `n` belongs to [1, 10,000].

## Solution
Each time compare two adjacent integers in the array. If there are two pairs of adjacent integers in the reversing order (the reversing order means the integer with a smaller index has a greater value), then return `false`.

If one pair of adjacent integers in the reversing order is found and the pair is not at the start or the end of the array, check the four adjacent numbers. Suppose `i >= 2` and the four adjacent numbers are `nums[i - 2]`, `nums[i - 1]`, `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`. If `nums[i] < nums[i - 2]` and `nums[i + 1] < nums[i - 1]`, then it is impossible to modify only one element to make the array sorted, so return `false`.

Otherwise, return `true`.
