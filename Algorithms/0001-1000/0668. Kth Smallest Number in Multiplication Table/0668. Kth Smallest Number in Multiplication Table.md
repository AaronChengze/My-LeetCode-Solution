# 668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table
## Level
Hard

## Description
Nearly every one have used the [Multiplication Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table). But could you find out the `k-th` smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

Given the height `m` and the length `n` of a `m * n` Multiplication Table, and a positive integer `k`, you need to return the `k-th` smallest number in this table.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6
3	6	9

The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 6
Explanation:
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6

The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
```

**Note:**
1. The `m` and `n` will be in the range [1, 30000].
2. The `k` will be in the range [1, m * n]

## Solution
Use binary search. For a Multiplication Table of height `m` and length `n`, the maximum number is `m * n`. Initialize `low = 1` and `high = m * n`. The condition of binary search is `low < high`. Each time let `mid` be the average of `low` and `high`, and calculate the rank of `mid` in the `m * n` Multiplication Table, which is the number of elements that are less than or equal to `mid`. If the rank is less than `k`, then obviously `mid` is too small, so set `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, set `high = mid`. Finally, return `low`.
