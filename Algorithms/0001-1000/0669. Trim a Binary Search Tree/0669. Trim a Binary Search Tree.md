# 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `L` and `R`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[L, R]` (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  0   2

  L = 1
  R = 2

Output: 
    1
      \
       2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
    3
   / \
  0   4
   \
    2
   /
  1

  L = 1
  R = 3

Output: 
      3
     / 
   2   
  /
 1
```

## Solution
While the root's value is less than `L`, move to the root's right child as the new root.

Maintain the nodes in the left subtree of the root. Use two variables to store the parent and the child, which are initially the root and the root's left child. If the child's value is less than `L`, then set the parent's left child to be the child's right child and set the child to be the right child (the new left child of the parent). If the child's value is greater than or equal to `L`, then move each node to its left child.

After the steps, all the nodes with value less than `L` are removed. Do the procedure for the right subtree and remove all the nodes with value greater than `R` similarly.
