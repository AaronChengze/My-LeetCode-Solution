## Description
There is a room with `n` lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. After performing exactly `m` unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the `n` lights could be.

Suppose `n` lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4 buttons are given below:

1. Flip all the lights.
2. Flip lights with even numbers.
3. Flip lights with odd numbers.
4. Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1, m = 1.

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Status can be: [on], [off]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 1.

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, m = 1.

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].

**Note:** n and m both fit in range [0, 1000].

## Solution
Use the idea of breadth first search. For each operation, there are 4 choices, so offer the next state of the lights after each choice of operation to the queue. To avoid duplicates, use a set to store the string representation of each possible state.

After *m* operations, return the size of the queue, which is the number of different kinds of state of the lights.
