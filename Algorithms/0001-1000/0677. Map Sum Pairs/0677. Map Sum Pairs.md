# 677. Map Sum Pairs
## Level
Medium

## Description
Implement a MapSum class with `insert`, and `sum` methods.

For the method `insert`, you'll be given a pair of (string, integer). The string represents the key and the integer represents the value. If the key already existed, then the original key-value pair will be overridden to the new one.

For the method `sum`, you'll be given a string representing the prefix, and you need to return the sum of all the pairs' value whose key starts with the prefix.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: insert("apple", 3), Output: Null
Input: sum("ap"), Output: 3
Input: insert("app", 2), Output: Null
Input: sum("ap"), Output: 5
```

## Solution
Several solutions exist for this problem. This solution is not guaranteed to be the optimal solution.

Use a map to store each (key, value) pair. For the constructor, initialize the map. For the method `insert`, put the (key, value) pair into the map. For the method `sum`, loop over all the keys in the map, and if a key has the corresponding prefix, add the value to the sum, and finally return the sum.

Other solutions like using the prefix or trie are also applicable.
