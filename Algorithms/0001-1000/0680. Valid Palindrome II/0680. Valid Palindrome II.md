# 680. Valid Palindrome II
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a non-empty string `s`, you may delete **at most** one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "aba"

**Output:** True

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "abca"

**Output:** True

**Explanation:** You could delete the character 'c'.

**Note:**
1. The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. The maximum length of the string is 50000.

## Solution
Use two pointers `low` and `high` which initially point to the start and the end of string `s`. While `low < high`, check the characters at `low` and `high`. If the two characters are the same, move both pointers toward the middle by 1 step. If `s` is already a palindrome, return `true`. If the two characters at `low` and `high` are different, check either the substring from `low + 1` to `high` or the substring from `low` to `high - 1` is a palindrome. If one of the substrings is a palindrome, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
