# 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find whether it's possible to divide this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4

**Output:** True

**Explanation:** It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

**Note:**

* `1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16`.
* `0 < nums[i] < 10000`.

## Solution
First calculate the sum of integers in `nums` and check whether the sum is divisible by `k`. If the sum is not divisible by `k`, then it is impossible to divide the array into `k` non-empty subsets with equal sums, so return `false`.

Calculate the sum of each subset. Sort the array and check whether the greatest integer in the array is less than or equal to the sum of each subset. If the greatest integer in the array is greater than the sum of each subset, return `false`.

Use backtrack to determine whether it is possible to divide the array into `k` non-empty subsets with equal sums. Try each number and add the number to the sum of the current subset. If the sum equals the sum of each subset, then consider the next subset. Continue the step until all subsets are found, and return `true`. If it is not possible, return `false`.
