# 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

For example, 
```
Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3
And the value to insert: 5
```
You can return this binary search tree:
```
         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   /
    1   3 5
```
This tree is also valid:
```
         5
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   
    1   3
         \
          4
```

## Solution
First find the position where the new node should be inserted. Starting from the root, compare the node's value with the value to be inserted. If the node's value is greater, move to the node's left child. If the node's value is less, move to the node's right child. If a leaf is met, insert the new node as the node's left child or right child.

Other solutions like AVL tree or red-black tree can also be used.
