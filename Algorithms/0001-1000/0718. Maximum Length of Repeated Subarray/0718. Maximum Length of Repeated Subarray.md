# 718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two integer arrays `A` and `B`, return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

A: [1,2,3,2,1]

B: [3,2,1,4,7]

**Output:** 3

*8Explanation: **

The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].

**Note:**

1. 1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
2. 0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `A.length + 1` rows and `B.length + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum length of repeated subarray of the two subarray `A[i..]` and `B[j..]`. Initially, all elements in `dp` are 0. For `i` from `A.length - 1` to 0 and `j` from `B.length - 1` to 0, if `A[i] == B[j]`, then there is a repeated subarray that starts from index `i` in `A` and index `j` in `B`, so update `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j + 1] + 1`, and update the maximum length of a repeated subarray. Finally, return the maximum length of a repeated subarray.
