# 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string S, find the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in S, and **return that number modulo `10^9 + 7`**.

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

S = 'bccb'

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.

Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

S = 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba'

**Output:** 104860361

**Explanation:**

There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Note:**

* The length of `S` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* Each character `S[i]` will be in the set `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `S.length()` rows and `S.length()` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of different palindromic subsequences in `S.substring(i, j + 1)`. Initialize `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `0 <= i < S.length()`. Then for `i` from `S.length() - 2` to 0 and for `j` from `i + 1` to `S.length() - 1`, obtain the letters at indices `i` and `j`, and calculate `dp[i][j]` depending on whether the two letters are the same.

If the two letters are the same, find the minimum `low` such that `S.charAt(low) == S.charAt(i)` and the maximum `high` such that `S.charAt(high) == S.charAt(j)`. If such indices `low` and `high` do not exist, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 + 2`. If `low == high`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 + 1`. If `low < high`, then `dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2 - dp[low + 1][high - 1]`.

If the two letters are different, simply calculate `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i + 1][j] - dp[i + 1][j - 1]`.
