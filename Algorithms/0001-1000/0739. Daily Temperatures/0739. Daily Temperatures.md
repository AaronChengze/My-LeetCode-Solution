# 739. Daily Temperatures
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a list of daily temperatures `T`, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0` instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures `T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`, your output should be `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.

**Note:** The length of temperatures will be in the range `[1, 30000]`. Each temperature will be an integer in the range `[30, 100]`.

## Solution
Loop over the array once. Use two stacks to store temperatures and indices respectively.

For each temperature in the array, check whether the temperature stack is not empty and the temperature at the top of the temperature stack is less than the current temperature. If this is the case, then pop the previous temperature and the previous index, and the number of days to wait for the previous day can be calculated. Put the number of days to wait for the previous day into the corresponding position in the array. Repeat the process until the temperature stack is empty or the top of the temperature stack is equal to or greater than the current temperature. Push the current temperature and the current index into the two stacks respectively.

Finally, return the result array.
