# 743. Network Delay Time
## Level
Medium

## Description
There are `N` network nodes, labelled `1` to `N`.

Given `times`, a list of travel times as **directed** edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)`, where `u` is the source node, `v` is the target node, and `w` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node `K`. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2

**Output:** 2

**Note:**

1. `N` will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
2. `K` will be in the range `[1, N]`.
3. The length of times will be in the range `[1, 6000]`.
4. All edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)` will have `1 <= u, v <= N` and `0 <= w <= 100`.

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Starting from node `K` and total time `0`, find all the nodes that the current node can reach, and update the next nodes' reach time if the next nodes haven't been reached. The search ends when no more nodes that haven't been reached can be visited anymore. If there is at least one node that haven't been reached, return `-1`. Otherwise, return the maximum reach time among all the nodes.
