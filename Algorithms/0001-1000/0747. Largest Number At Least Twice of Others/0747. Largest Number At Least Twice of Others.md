# 747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others
## Level
Easy

## Description
In a given integer array `nums`, there is always exactly one largest element.

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.

If it is, return the **index** of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x, 6 is more than twice as big as x. The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

**Note:**

1. `nums` will have a length in the range `[1, 50]`.
2. Every `nums[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 99]`.

## Solution
If `nums` has length 1, then the one element in `nums` is the largest element, which is at index 0, so return 0.

If `nums` has length greater than 1, then sort `nums` in ascending order, with indices of each number maintained as well. After sorting, obtain the largest element and the second largest element. If the largest element is at least twice as much as the second largest element, return the index of the largest element. Otherwise, return -1.
