# 753. Cracking the Safe
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be one of the first `k` digits `0, 1, ..., k-1`.

While entering a password, the last `n` digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is `"345"`, if you type `"012345"`, the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of **minimum length** that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 2

**Output:** "01"

**Note:** "10" will be accepted too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, k = 2

**Output:** "00110"

**Note:** "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.

**Note:**

1. `n` will be in the range `[1, 4]`.
2. `k` will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
3. `k^n` will be at most `4096`.

## Solution
Use Hierholzer's algorithm to find an Euler cycle in an Euler graph. Initially create a string with `n - 1` 0's. Starting from the initial string, do depth first search. Each time append a new digit from 0 to `k - 1` to the string and check whether the new string has been visited. If it has not been visited, then mark it as visited and remove the leftmost digit to continue depth first search, and append the last digit to the input string. Finally, return the input string.
