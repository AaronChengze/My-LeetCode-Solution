# 754. Reach a Number
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are standing at position `0` on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position `target`.

On each move, you can either go left or right. During the *n*-th move (starting from 1), you take *n* steps.

Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.

**Example 1:**

**Input**: target = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

On the first move we step from 0 to 1.

On the second step we step from 1 to 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

On the first move we step from 0 to 1.

On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.

On the third move we step from -1 to 2.

**Note:**
* `target` will be a non-zero integer in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

## Solution
If *n* moves are taken, the maximum position that can be reached is *n*(*n*+1)/2, so if *n* is the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination, there must be `n(n+1)/2 >= target`. Also, `n(n+1)/2` and `target` must be both odd or both even. The reason is that suppose a move with `x` steps is reversed to reach the `target, then there is `target = n(n+1)/2 - 2x`. Since `x` is a positive integer, `target` and `n(n+1)/2` must be both odd or both even.

If `target` is negative, consider `-target` instead since only the directions of each move need to be changed but the total number of moves remains the same.

And the minimum number of moves can be obtained in such a way.
