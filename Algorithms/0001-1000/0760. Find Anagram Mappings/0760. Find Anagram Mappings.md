# 760. Find Anagram Mappings
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two lists `A` and `B`, and `B` is an anagram of `A`. `B` is an anagram of `A` means `B` is made by randomizing the order of the elements in `A`.

We want to find an *index mapping* `P`, from `A` to `B`. A mapping `P[i] = j` means the `i`th element in `A` appears in `B` at index `j`.

These lists `A` and `B` may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.

For example, given
```
A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
```
We should return
```
[1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
```
as `P[0] = 1` because the `0`th element of `A` appears at `B[1]`, and `P[1] = 4` because the `1`st element of `A` appears at `B[4]`, and so on.

**Note:**

1. `A, B` have equal lengths in range `[1, 100]`.
2. `A[i], B[i]` are integers in range `[0, 10^5]`.

## Solution
Use a list to store the numbers from `B`. For each number in `A`, find the index of the number in `B` and assign the index in the index mapping. After this step, set the element at the index in `B` to -1 to avoid using the same index in `B` more than once. Finally, return the index mapping.
