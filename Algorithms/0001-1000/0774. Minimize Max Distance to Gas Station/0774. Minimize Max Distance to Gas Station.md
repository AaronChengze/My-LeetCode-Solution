# 774. Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station
## Level
Hard

## Description
On a horizontal number line, we have gas stations at positions `stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[N-1]`, where `N = stations.length`.

Now, we add `K` more gas stations so that **D**, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, is minimized.

Return the smallest possible value of **D**.

**Example:**

**Input:** stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], K = 9

**Output:** 0.500000

**Note:**

1. `stations.length` will be an integer in range `[10, 2000]`.
2. `stations[i]` will be an integer in range `[0, 10^8]`.
3. `K` will be an integer in range `[1, 10^6]`.
4. Answers within `10^-6` of the true value will be accepted as correct.

## Solution
Use binary search. Sort `stations` and initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the difference between the maximum element in `stations` and the minimum element in `stations`. While `high - low > 1e-6`, do binary search. Each time set `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high` and use `mid` as a candidate of **D** to calculate the minimum number of gas stations to be added. If the minimum number of gas stations to be added is less than or equal to `K`, then set `high = mid`. Otherwise, set `low = mid`. Finally, return `low`.
