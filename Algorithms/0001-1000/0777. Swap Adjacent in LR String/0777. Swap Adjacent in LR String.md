# 777. Swap Adjacent in LR String
## Level
Medium

## Description
In a string composed of `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'` characters, like `"RXXLRXRXL"`, a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of `"XL"` with `"LX"`, or replacing one occurrence of `"RX"` with `"XR"`. Given the starting string `start` and the ending string `end`, return `True` if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.

**Example:**
```
Input: start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
Output: True
Explanation:
We can transform start to end following these steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= len(start) = len(end) <= 10000`.
2. Both start and end will only consist of characters in `{'L', 'R', 'X'}`.

## Solution
A move can move a letter `'L'` to the left by one step if the letter to its left is a letter `'X'`, or move a letter `'R'` to the right by one step if the letter to its right is a letter `'X'`. The number of letters `'L'` and `'R'` and the relative order of letters `'L'` and `'R'` do not change after each move.

Loop over both strings `start` and `end`, and store the indices of all letters `'L'` and `'R'` in two lists respectively. To distinguish the indices of `'L'` and `'R'`, increase each index by 1 so that the index won't be 0, and for letters `'L'`, store the opposite numbers of the indices.

The two lists should have the same size. If not, return `false`. Loop over both lists and obtain each pair of indices. Suppose the two indices in the pair are `index1` and `index2`. If `index1` and `index2` have different signs (i.e. one is positive and the other is negative), then the two characters do not match, so return `false`. If both indices are positive, then the case should be `index1 <= index2` so that the moves are valid. If `index1 > index2`, return `false`. If both indices are negative, then the case should be `Math.abs(index1) >= Math.abs(index2)`, which is equivalent to `index1 <= index2`, so that the moves are valid. If `index1 > index2`, return `false`. In brief, for each pair of indices `(index1, index2)`, if `index1` and `index2` have different signs or `index1 > index2`, return `false`. If no conflict is met, return `true`.
