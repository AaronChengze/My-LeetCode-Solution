# 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling
## Level
Medium

## Description
We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.
```
XX <- domino

XX <- "L" tromino
X
```
Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? **Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.**

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

**Example:**
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
```

**Note:**

* N will be in range `[1, 1000]`.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. For `N <= 2`, the results are straightforward. If `N` equals 0 or 1, the result is 1 (note that when `N` equals 0, no tile is needed, which counts for one way). If `N` equals 2, the result is 2.

For `N >= 3`, the board can be tiled by adding one vertical domino after `N - 1` columns, which counts for one way, or adding two horizontal dominoes after `N - 2` columns, which counts for one way, or adding two trominoes and several dominoes after `N - k` columns where `3 <= k <= N`, which count for two ways for each `k`.

Let `f(N)` be the number of ways to tile a 2 x N board. It can be seen that f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, and for N >= 3, f(N) = f(N - 1) + f(N - 2) + (f(0) + f(1) + ... + f(N - 3)) * 2. Apply the same recurrence formula for f(N - 1), and it can be induced that for N >= 3, f(N) = f(N - 1) * 2 + f(N - 3). Apply this formula to obtain f(N).
