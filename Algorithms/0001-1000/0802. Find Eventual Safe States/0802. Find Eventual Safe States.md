## Description
In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph. If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is *eventually safe* if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there exists a natural number `K` so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `K` steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe? Return them as an array in sorted order.

The directed graph has `N` nodes with labels `0, 1, ..., N-1`, where `N` is the length of graph. The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph.

**Example:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]

**Output:** [2,4,5,6]

Here is a diagram of the above graph.

**Note:**

* `graph` will have length at most `10000`.
* The number of edges in the graph will not exceed `32000`.
* Each `graph[i]` will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range `[0, graph.length - 1]`.

## Solution
Use topological sort. For each node from 0 to `N-1`, store its next nodes and its previons nodes. If there is a directed edge `(i, j)`, then `i` is a previous node of `j` and `j` is a next node of `i`.

Consider the edges backwards. If a node does not have any next node, then the node is eventually safe. Starting from such nodes, find each node's previous nodes, and for each previous node, obtain the previous node's next nodes and delete the current node from the previous node's next nodes. If the previous node does not have any next node after deletion, then the previous node is also eventually safe, so continue searching on the previous node. Finally, return all the nodes that are eventually safe.
