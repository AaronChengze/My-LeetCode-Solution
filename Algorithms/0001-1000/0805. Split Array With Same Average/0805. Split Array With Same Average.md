# 805. Split Array With Same Average
## Level
Hard

## Description
In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)

Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.

**Example:**

**Input:**

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have the average of 4.5.

**Note:**

* The length of `A` will be in the range [1, 30].
* `A[i]` will be in the range of `[0, 10000]`.

## Solution
If `A` has length less than 2, simply return `false`.

Sort array `A`. If the last element of `A` is 0, then all elements are 0, so return `true`. Otherwise, calculate the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A` and divide all elements in `A` by the greatest common divisor. Then calculate the sum of all elements in `A`. If the greatest common divisor of the sum and the length of `A` is 1, return `false`. For each possible combination of elements in `A`, check whether the average of the elements in the combination equals the average of all elements in `A`. If so, return `true`. If no such combination is found, return `false`.
