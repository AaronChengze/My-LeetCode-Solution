# 812. Largest Triangle Area
## Level
Easy

## Description
You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

**Example:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.

**Notes:**

* `3 <= points.length <= 50`.
* No points will be duplicated.
* `-50 <= points[i][j] <= 50`.
* Answers within `10^-6` of the true value will be accepted as correct.

## Solution
For all possible combinations of selecting 3 points from `points`, use the three points to form a triangle and calculate the area of the triangle.

Heron's formula is used for calculating the area of a triangle. Suppose the three sides of a triangle have length `a`, `b` and `c` respectively, then let `p = (a + b + c) / 2`, and the area of the triangle is `Math.sqrt(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c))`.

Return the area of the largest triangle.
