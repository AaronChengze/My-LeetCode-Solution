# 815. Bus Routes
## Level
Hard

## Description
We have a list of bus routes. Each `routes[i]` is a bus route that the i-th bus repeats forever. For example if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the first bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->... forever.

We start at bus stop `S` (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus stop `T`. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.

**Example:**

**Input:**

routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]

S = 1

T = 6

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the second bus to the bus stop 6.

**Note:**

* 1 <= routes.length <= 500`.
* 1 <= routes[i].length <= 500`.
* 0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6`.

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Use a map to store each route and the routes that have intersection with the route (which means the two routes have at least one common stop). Use a set to store the visited routes and use another set to store the routes that can reach `T`. Starting from the routes that contain `S`, find the routes that have intersection with the current route, until a route that can reach `T` is met.
