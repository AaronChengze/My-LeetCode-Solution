# 821. Shortest Distance to a Character
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `S` and a character `C`, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character `C` in the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'

**Output:** [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]

**Note:**

1. `S` string length is in `[1, 10000]`.
2. `C` is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string `S`.
3. All letters in `S` and `C` are lowercase.

## Solution
Loop over `S` to find the indices where the character is `C`. Then for each index from 0 to `S.length() - 1`, calculate the shortest distance. If the character at the index is `C`, then the distance at the index is 0. Otherwise, find the one nearest index or the two nearest indices and calculate the shortest distance.
