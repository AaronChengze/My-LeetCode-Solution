# 829. Consecutive Numbers Sum
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a positive integer `N`, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** 5 = 5 = 2 + 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 9

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 15

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** 15 = 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

**Note:** `1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9`.

## Solution
If `N` can be written as a sum of `i` consecutive positive integers, then there must be `i * (i + 1) / 2 <= N`, which means `i` cannot exceed `max = (int) Math.sqrt(N * 2)`. For each number `i` from 1 to `max`, how to determine whether `N` can be written as a sum of `i` consecutive positive integers? Consider two cases, where `i` is odd and even respectively.

If `i` is odd, then `N` can be written as a sum of `i` consecutive positive integers if `N % i == 0`.

If `i` is even, then `N` can be written as a sum of `i` consecutive positive integers if `N % i != 0` and `N * 2 % i == 0`.
