# 830. Positions of Large Groups
## Level
Easy

## Description
In a string `S` of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like `S = "abbxxxxzyy"` has the groups `"a"`, `"bb"`, `"xxxx"`, `"z"` and `"yy"`.

Call a group *large* if it has 3 or more characters. We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "abbxxxxzzy"

**Output:** [[3,6]]

**Explanation:** "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "abc"

**Output:** []

**Explanation:** We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"

**Output:** [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]

**Note:** `1 <= S.length <= 1000`

## Solution
Loop over each character in string `S` to find the groups in `S`. If the current character is different from the previous character, then the previous group ends, so calculate the previous group's length. If the group's length is greater than or equal to 3, then it is a large group, so add the starting and ending positions to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
