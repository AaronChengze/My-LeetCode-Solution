# 834. Sum of Distances in Tree
## Level
Hard

## Description
An undirected, connected tree with `N` nodes labelled `0...N-1` and `N-1` `edges` are given.

The `i`th edge connects nodes `edges[i][0]` and `edges[i][1]` together.

Return a list `ans`, where `ans[i]` is the sum of the distances between node `i` and all other nodes.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
Explanation: 
Here is a diagram of the given tree:
  0
 / \
1   2
   /|\
  3 4 5
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.  Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.
```

Note: `1 <= N <= 10000`

## Solution
Create two arrays `counts` and `sums` of length `N`, where `counts[i]` represents the number of nodes in the subtree that has root `i` and `sums` is the result array. Initialize all elements in `counts` to 1.

Do depth first search starting from node 0 for two times.

For the first time, calculate the array `counts` and each root's value of `sums`. For each node `i` that is not a leaf, `counts[i]` is the sum of all elements `counts[j]` plus 1 and `sums[i]` is the sum of all elements `sums[j]` and `counts[j]`, where `j` is a child of `i`.

For the second time, calculate each child's value of `sums`. For each node `i` that is not 0, if its parent is `j`, then `sums[i] = sums[j] + counts[i] + N - counts[i]`.
