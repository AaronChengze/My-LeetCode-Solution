# 861. Score After Flipping Matrix
## Level
Medium

## Description
We have a two dimensional matrix `A` where each value is `0` or `1`.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all `0`s to `1`s, and all `1`s to `0`s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]

**Output:** 39

**Explanation:**

Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].

0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 20`
2. `1 <= A[0].length <= 20`
3. `A[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution
First flip the rows where the highest bit is 0. After flipping, all rows will have the highest bit 1.

Next flip the columns where the number of 1's is less than the number of 0's.

Finally, add all the binary numbers in each row to obtain the highest possible score.
