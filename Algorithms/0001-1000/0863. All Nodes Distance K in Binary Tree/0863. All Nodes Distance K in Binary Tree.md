# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
We are given a binary tree (with root node `root`), a `target` node, and an integer value `K`.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the `target` node. The answer can be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

**Output:** [7,4,1]

**Explanation:**

The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1.

Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes. The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.

**Note:**

1. The given tree is non-empty.
2. Each node in the tree has unique values `0 <= node.val <= 500`.
3. The `target` node is a node in the tree.
4. ~0 <= K <= 1000`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search on the binary tree and store each node's path from root. For the root, the path is empty. For other nodes, the path is a string of zeros and ones.

For each node, calculate the difference between the node's path and the target's path. To calculate the difference, find the minimum index that the two paths differ, and calculate the sum of the letters from this index to the end in both arrays. If the difference is `K`, then add the node's value to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
