# 869. Reordered Power of 2
## Level
Medium

## Description
Starting with a positive integer `N`, we reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return true if and only if we can do this in a way such that the resulting number is a power of 2.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 10

**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 16

**Output:** true

**Example 4:**

**Input:** 24

**Output:** false

**Example 5:**

**Input:** 46

**Output:** true

**Note:**

`1 <= N <= 10^9`

## Solution
If `N` equals 10^9, then return `false`. Deal with this special case first to avoid overflow.

If `N` contains only one digit, check whether `N` equals 1, 2, 4, or 8. If `N` is one of the four numbers, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

For general cases, obtain the number of digits in `N`, which is `k`, and find the minimum possible `k`-digit number that is a power of 2 and the maximum possible `k`-digit number that is a power of 2. For each number that is a power of 2 in the range, count the number of occurrences for each digit from 0 to 9, and compare the numbers of occurrences for each digit with the numbers of occurrences for each digit of number `N`. If there exists a number such that the numbers of occurrences for each digit equals the numbers of occurrences for each digit of number `N`, return `true`. If no such number is found, return `false`.
