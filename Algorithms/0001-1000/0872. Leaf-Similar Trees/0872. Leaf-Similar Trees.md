# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees
## Level
Easy

## Description
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a *leaf value sequence*.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.

Two binary trees are considered *leaf-similar* if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

**Note:**

* Both of the given trees will have between `1` and `100` nodes.

## Solution
For the two binary trees, obtain the leaf value sequence of each binary tree.

To obtain a binary tree's leaf value sequence, use breadth first search, where a queue is used to store the nodes to be visited. Each time obtain the number of nodes in the queue, which is `size`, and visit the first `size` nodes in the queue. If a node has one or more children, then offer the node's children to the queue. If a node is a leaf, then simply offer the node to the queue again. If all the nodes in the queue are leaf, then no more children will be discovered, so add all the leaf nodes' values to a list and return the list, which is the leaf value sequence.

After the leaf value sequences of the two binary trees are obtained, check whether they are the same.
