# 878. Nth Magical Number
## Level
Hard

## Description
A positive integer is *magical* if it is divisible by either A or B.

Return the N-th magical number. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 1, A = 2, B = 3

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 4, A = 2, B = 3

**Output:** 6

**Example 3:**

**Input:** N = 5, A = 2, B = 4

**Output:** 10

**Example 4:**

**Input:** N = 3, A = 6, B = 4

**Output:** 8

**Note:**

1. `1 <= N <= 10^9`
2. `2 <= A <= 40000`
3. `2 <= B <= 40000`

## Solution
The N-th magical number before the modulo operation can always be held by a `long` data type, considering the ranges of `N`, `A` and `B`.

To simplify the scenario, if `A` is greater than `B`, then swap `A` and `B` so that the case is always `A <= B`.

If `B` is divisible by `A` (for example, `A = 2` and `B = 10`), then any number that is divisible by `B` is also divisible by `A`, so the N-th magical number is `A * N`.

For other cases, calculate the least common multiple of `A` and `B`, which is `lcm`. The number of magical numbers from 1 to `lcm` is `count = lcm / A + lcm / B - 1`. Define a "group" to be a group of numbers from the previous common divisor exclusive to the next common divisor inclusive. Calculate `groups = N / count` and `remainder = N % count`. The greatest number in the last complete group is `num = lcm * groups`. If `remainder` is 0, the N-th magical number is `num`. Otherwise, find the `remainder`-th magical number in the first group, which is `magicalNum`, and add `magicalNum` to `num`. After the steps, `num` is the N-th magical number.
