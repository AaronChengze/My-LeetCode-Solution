# 881. Boats to Save People
## Level
Medium

## Description
The `i`-th person has weight `people[i]`, and each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** people = [1,2], limit = 3

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** 1 boat (1, 2)

**Example 2:**

**Input:** people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

**Example 3:**

**Input:** people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

**Note:**

* `1 <= people.length <= 50000`
* `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000`

## Solution
Since each boat can carry at most 2 people, and it is guaranteed that each person can be carried by a boat, for each boat, there are two cases. The first case is that the person with the maximum weight and the person with the minimum weight are carried by the same boat, if their total weight does not exceed `limit`. The second case is that a boat only carries the person with the maximum weight. At each step, for the remaining people, use the first case if it can be met, or use the second case otherwise.

Sort the array `people`, and use two pointers `low` and `high` that point to 0 and `people.length - 1` initially. Each time calculate `people[low] + people[high]`. If the sum does not exceed `limit`, then the two people can be carried by one boat, so increase `low` by 1 and decrease `high` by 1. Otherwise, only the people with weight `people[high]` can be carried, so only decrease `high` by 1. In both cases, increase the number of boats by 1.

Finally, return the number of boats.
