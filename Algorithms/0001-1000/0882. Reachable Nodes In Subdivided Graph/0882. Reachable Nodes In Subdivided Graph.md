# 882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph
## Level
Hard

## Description
Starting with an **undirected** graph (the "original graph") with nodes from `0` to `N-1`, subdivisions are made to some of the edges.

The graph is given as follows: `edges[k]` is a list of integer pairs `(i, j, n)` such that `(i, j)` is an edge of the original graph, and `n` is the total number of **new** nodes on that edge. 

Then, the edge `(i, j)` is deleted from the original graph, `n` new nodes `(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` are added to the original graph, and `n+1` new edges `(i, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{n-1}, x_n), (x_n, j)` are added to the original graph.

Now, you start at node `0` from the original graph, and in each move, you travel along one edge. 

Return how many nodes you can reach in at most `M` moves.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], M = 6, N = 3

**Output:** 13

**Explanation:**

The nodes that are reachable in the final graph after M = 6 moves are indicated below.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], M = 10, N = 4

**Output:** 23

**Note:**

1. `0 <= edges.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= edges[i][0] < edges[i][1] < N`
3. There does not exist any `i != j` for which `edges[i][0] == edges[j][0]` and `edges[i][1] == edges[j][1]`.
4. The original graph has no parallel edges.
5. `0 <= edges[i][2] <= 10000`
6. `0 <= M <= 10^9`
7. `1 <= N <= 3000`
8. A reachable node is a node that can be travelled to using at most M moves starting from node 0.

## Solution
After new nodes are inserted, the length of the original edges can be determined. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the distance between each node and node 0, and a node is reachable if and only if its distance from node 0 does not exceed `M`.

Then for each original edge with new nodes inserted, obtain the number of new nodes that can be reached, which is calculated during the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the distances.
