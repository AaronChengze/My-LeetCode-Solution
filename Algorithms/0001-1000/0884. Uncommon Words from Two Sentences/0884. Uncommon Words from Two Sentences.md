# 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
## Level
Easy

## Description
We are given two sentences `A` and `B`. (A *sentence* is a string of space separated words. Each *word* consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is *uncommon* if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"

**Output:** ["sweet","sour"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = "apple apple", B = "banana"

**Output:** ["banana"]

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 200`
2. `0 <= B.length <= 200`
3. `A` and `B` both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.

## Solution
Use a set to store all the words that occur in `A` and `B`, and use a list to store all uncommon words. If a word is not in the set, then add it to the set and to the list. If a word is already in the set, which means the word occurs more than once, then remove it from the list. Finally, use an array to store all uncommon words and return the array.
