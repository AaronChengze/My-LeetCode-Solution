# 894. All Possible Full Binary Trees
## Level
Medium

## Description
A *full binary tree* is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with `N` nodes. Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each `node` of each tree in the answer **must** have `node.val = 0`.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 7

**Output:** [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]

* `1 <= N <= 20`

## Solution
A full binary tree must have odd number of nodes. The reason is as follows. If a binary tree contains only one node, it is a full binary tree, and one is odd. Since each node has exactly 0 or 2 children, for each node in a full binary tree, if the node is not a leaf, then two children are added to the node and two nodes are added to the binary tree. Since two is even, adding any even numbers to an odd number will always lead to an odd number, so the number of nodes in a full binary tree is odd. Therefore, if the input is even, simply return an empty list.

For an odd input `N`, generate all possible full binary trees with node numbers from 1 to `N`, where only odd node numbers need to be considered. Use a map to store the list of full binary trees for each number of nodes. For a full binary tree with `N` nodes, its left subtree has `left` nodes and its subtree has `right` nodes, where both `left` and `right` are odd numbers in the range `[1, N - 2]` and `left + right == N - 1`.

Finally, return the list of full binary trees with `N` nodes.
