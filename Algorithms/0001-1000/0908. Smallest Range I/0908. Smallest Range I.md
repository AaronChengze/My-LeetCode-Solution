## Description
Given an array `A` of integers, for each integer `A[i]` we may choose any `x` with `-K <= x <= K`, and add `x` to `A[i]`.

After this process, we have some array `B`.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of `B` and the minimum value of `B`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [1], K = 0

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** B = [1]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [0,10], K = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** B = [2,8]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** A = [1,3,6], K = 3

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** B = [3,3,3] or B = [4,4,4]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `0 <= K <= 10000`

## Solution
Sort the array `A` to find the minimum value and the maximum value in `A`. If the difference between the values is less than `2 * K`, then it is always possible to make the minimum value and the maximum value equal to each other. Otherwise, add `K` to the minimum value and subtract `K` from the maximum value, which will make the difference between the two values decrease by `2 * K`, and the new difference is the smalles possible difference.

All the values between the minimum value and the maximum value can still be between the two values.
