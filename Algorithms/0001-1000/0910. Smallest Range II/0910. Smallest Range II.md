## Description
Given an array `A` of integers, for each integer `A[i]` we need to choose **either `x = -K` **or** `x = K`, and add `x` to `A[i]` **(only once)**.

After this process, we have some array `B`.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of `B` and the minimum value of `B`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [1], K = 0

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** B = [1]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [0,10], K = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** B = [2,8]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** A = [1,3,6], K = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** B = [4,6,3]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `0 <= K <= 10000`

## Solution
First sort the array `A`, find the maximum element and the minimum element and calculate the difference.

Next consider whether each number should be added `K` or `-K`. For any two numbers `num1` and `num2`, if `num1 < num2`, then adding `K` to `num1` and adding `-K` to `num2` is always optimal.

After `A` is sorted, find the maximum index `i` such that `A[i]` should be added `K`, and the minimum difference can be obtained.
