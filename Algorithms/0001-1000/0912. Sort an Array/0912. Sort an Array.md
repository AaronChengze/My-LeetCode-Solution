# 912. Sort an Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,2,3,1]

**Output:** [1,2,3,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]

**Output:** [0,0,1,1,2,5]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 50000`
* `-50000 <= nums[i] <= 50000`

## Solution
There are several ways to sort an array. This solution uses merge sort, which has a time complexity of O(*n* log *n*), where *n* is the number of elements to be sorted.

If there are at least 2 elements in the array, then split the elements into two subarrays, sort each subarray, and merge the two sorted subarrays. To merge two sorted subarrays, while there are remaining elements in both subarrays, always select the smaller element to add to the merged list and move to the next element where the smaller element is selected (if there is a tie, select the element from the first subarray to make merge sort stable). If only one subarray contains remaining elements, then add all the remaining elements from the subarray to the merged list, in the sorted order.
