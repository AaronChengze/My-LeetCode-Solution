# 928. Minimize Malware Spread II
## Level
Hard

## Description
(This problem is the same as *Minimize Malware Spread*, with the differences bolded.)

In a network of nodes, each node `i` is directly connected to another node `j` if and only if `graph[i][j] = 1`.

Some nodes `initial` are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose `M(initial)` is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove one node from the initial list, **completely removing it and any connections from this node to any other node**. Return the node that if removed, would minimize `M(initial)`. If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, return such a node with the smallest index.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]

**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,1]], initial = [0,1]

**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1],[0,0,1,1]], initial = [0,1]

**Output:** 1

**Note:**

1. `1 < graph.length = graph[0].length <= 300`
2. `0 <= graph[i][j] == graph[j][i] <= 1`
3. `graph[i][i] = 1`
4. `1 <= initial.length < graph.length`
5. `0 <= initial[i] < graph.length`

## Solution
Do breadth first search on the graph. Use two maps to store each node in `initial` and the nodes that are not in `initial` and connected to the node, and to store each node that is not in `initial` and the nodes that are in `initial` and connected to the node, respectively.

Then for each node A in `initial`, obtain the nodes that are not in `initial` and connected to the node. For each such node B, if it is only connected to one node in `initial`, then after removing the node in `initial`, the node B will not be infected. In this way, after each node in `initial` is removed, the number of nodes that will not be infected can be calculated. Find the node in `initial` such that after removing the node, the number of nodes that will not be infected is maximized, and return the node.
