# 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
In an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, how many **non-empty** subarrays have sum `S`?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The 4 subarrays are bolded below:

[**1,0,1**,0,1]

[**1,0,1,0**,1]

[1,**0,1,0,1**]

[1,0,**1,0,1**]

**Note:**

1. `A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= S <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Solution
Use a map to count the number of subarrays starting from index 0 that have sum equal to a given value.

If `S` is 0, then for each possible sum in the map, count the number of subarrays of the sum. If there are `k` such subarrays, then the number of non-empty subarrays obtained from such subarrays is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. Count the number of non-empty subarrays with sum 0 from all possible sums in the map.

If `S` is positive, then for each pair `(i, i + S)` such that `i >= 0` and `i + S` doesn't exceed the maximum possible sum (which is the sum of all numbers in the array), let `count1` and `count2` be the numbers of subarrays starting from index 0 that have sum `i` and sum `i + S` respectively, and the number of non-empty subarrays with sum `S` for the pair `(i, i + S)` is `count1 * count2`. Count the number of non-empty subarrays with sum `S` from all possible sums in the map.
