# 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **square** array of integers `A`, we want the minimum sum of a *falling path* through `A`.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row.  The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**
 
The possible falling paths are:
* `[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]`
* `[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]`
* `[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]`

The falling path with the smallest sum is `[1,4,7]`, so the answer is 12.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100`
2. `-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let `side` be the side length of array `A` (since `A` is a square array, the number of rows and the number of columns are the same, so use `side` to represent the number of rows or columns). Create a square array `dp` with side length `side`. Each element in `dp` represents the minimum sum of a falling path that ends at this cell.

The numbers in row 0 of `dp` are just the same as the numbers in row 0 of `A`. For rows 1 to the bottom, each number in `dp` equals the minimum of the two or three adjacent values in the previous row of `dp` plus the current value in `A`.

Finally, find the minimum in the last row of `dp`, which is the minimum sum of a falling path through `A`.
