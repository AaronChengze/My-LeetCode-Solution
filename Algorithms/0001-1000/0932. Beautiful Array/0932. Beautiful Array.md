# 932. Beautiful Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
For some fixed `N`, an array `A` is *beautiful* if it is a permutation of the integers `1, 2, ..., N`, such that:

For every `i < j`, there is **no** `k` with `i < k < j` such that `A[k] * 2 = A[i] + A[j]`.

Given `N`, return **any** beautiful array `A`. (It is guaranteed that one exists.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 4

**Output:** [2,1,4,3]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 5

**Output:** [3,1,2,5,4]

**Note:**

* `1 <= N <= 1000`

## Solution
There are several ways to generate a beautiful array. This solution generates a beautiful array iteratively.

If `N` is 1, then the array only contains an element 1, which is a beautiful array.

If a beautiful array `arr1` of length `N` is generated, then a beautiful array `arr2` of length `2N` can also be generated using the following steps.

1. For each index i from 0 to `N - 1`, set `arr2[i] = arr1[i] * 2`. Since `arr1` is a beautiful array, there is no `k` with `0 <= i < k < j < N` such that `arr1[k] * 2 = arr1[i] + arr1[j]`, and also there is no such `k` that makes `arr1[k] * 2 * 2 = arr1[i] * 2 + arr1[j] * 2`. Since `arr2[i] = arr1[i] * 2` for all indices `i` such that `0 <= i < N`, there is no `k` with `0 <= i < k < j < N` such that `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]`.

2. For each index i from `N` to `2N - 1`, set `arr2[i] = arr2[2N - i - 1] - 1`. For example, if `N = 4` and `arr1` is `[4,2,1,3]`, then `arr2` is `[8,4,2,6,5,1,3,7]`. Since there is no `k` with `0 <= i < k < j < N` such that `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]`, there is also no `p` with `N <= m < p < n < 2N` such that `arr2[p] * 2 = arr2[m] + arr2[n]`. Suppose `i + m = j + n = k + p = 2N - 1`, then `arr2[p] = arr2[k] - 1`, `arr2[m] = arr2[i] - 1`, and `arr2[n] = arr2[j] - 1`, so `arr2[p] * 2 = arr2[m] + arr2[n]` is equivalent to `(arr2[k] - 1) * 2 = arr2[i] - 1 + arr2[j] - 1`, which is further equivalent to `arr2[k] * 2 - 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j] - 2` and `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]`. Since `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]` is impossible, `arr2[p] * 2 = arr2[m] + arr2[n]` is also impossible.

After the two steps, all the elements in the left half of `arr2` are even numbers and all the elements in the right half of `arr2` are odd numbers, and it can be seen that the indices `i`, `j` and `k` can't be in the same half of the array to make `0 <= i < k < j < 2N` and `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]`. Is it possible that such `i`, `j` and `k` exist when `0 <= i < N <= j < 2N` and `i < k < j` and `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]`?

Since for any `k` such that `0 <= k < 2N`, `arr2[k] * 2` is always an even number, if there exist `i`, `j` and `k` with `0 <= i < k < j < N` such that `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]`, then `arr2[i]` and `arr2[j]` must be both odd or both even. However, if `0 <= i < N <= j < 2N`, then `arr2[i]` must be even and `arr2[j]` must be odd, so it is impossible to find indices `i`, `j`, and `k` such that `i < k < j` and `0 <= i < N <= j < 2N` and `arr2[k] * 2 = arr2[i] + arr2[j]`.

Therefore, `arr2` is also a beautiful array.

Starting from a beautiful array of length 1, a beautiful array of length 2 can be generated, and then a beautiful array of length 4, and then length 8, etc. If `N` is between 2<sup>*q*-1</sup> and 2<sup>*q*</sup> where *q* is a positive integer and `*q* > 1, then first generate a beautiful array of length 2<sup>*q*</sup>, and then generate a beautiful array of length `N` by deleting the numbers greater than `N`.

Finally, return the beautiful array of length `N`.
