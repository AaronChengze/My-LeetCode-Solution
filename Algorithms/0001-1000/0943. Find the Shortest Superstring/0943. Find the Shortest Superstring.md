# 943. Find the Shortest Superstring
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array A of strings, find any smallest string that contains each string in `A` as a substring.

We may assume that no string in `A` is substring of another string in `A`.
 
**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["alex","loves","leetcode"]

**Output:** "alexlovesleetcode"

**Explanation:** All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]

**Output:** "gctaagttcatgcatc"

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 12`
2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`

## Solution
First for each pair of strings in `A`, calculate the number of letters that overlap. Then use dynamic programming. If there are `n` strings in `A`, then there are `1 << n` different states where each string is selected or not selected. For each state that ends with string `A[i]`, find a string `A[j]` such that `i != j` and the total number of overlapping letters is maximized if `A[j]` is just before `A[i]`, and store the number of overlapping letters and each string's parent string's index. Then use the parents information to form the shortest superstring.
