# 946. Validate Stack Sequences
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two sequences `pushed` and `popped` **with distinct values**, return `true` if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** We might do the following sequence: push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4, push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** 1 cannot be popped before 2.

**Note:**

1. `0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000`
2. `0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000`
3. `pushed` is a permutation of `popped`.
4. `pushed` and `popped` have distinct values.

## Solution
Loop over both arrays `pushed` and `popped` from left to right. For each element in `pushed`, push it into the stack and check whether the current element in `popped` equals the top element of the stack. If so, pop the top element from the stack and move to the next element in `pushed`. Continue the `pop` process until the stack becomes empty or the top element of the stack doesn't equal to the current element in `popped`.

Since both `pushed` and `popped` have the same length, after all the `push` and `pop` operations, there should be no elements in the stack, so return `true` if and only if the stack is empty.
