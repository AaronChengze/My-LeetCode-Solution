# 952. Largest Component Size by Common Factor
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a non-empty array of unique positive integers `A`, consider the following graph:

* There are `A.length` nodes, labelled `A[0]` to `A[A.length - 1]`;
* There is an edge between `A[i]` and `A[j]` if and only if `A[i]` and `A[j]` share a common factor greater than 1.

Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [4,6,15,35]

**Output:** 4

**Input:** [2,3,6,7,4,12,21,39]

**Output:** 8

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 100000`

## Solution
Use union find. For each integer in `A`, obtain all the integer's factors that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of the integer. For each such factor, update the integer's ancestor and the factor's ancestor accordingly. After union find, all the integers that belong to the same connected component will have the same ancestor. Then for each ancestor, find the maximum size and return the maximum size.
