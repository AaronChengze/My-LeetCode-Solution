# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a *complete binary tree*.

**Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):**

In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2<sup>h</sup> nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,5,6]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
 
**Note:**

1. The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

## Solution
Use breadth first search and visit the nodes in the same level each time. For level h, there should be at most 2<sup>h</sup> nodes.

If there are 2<sup>h</sup> nodes in level h, then for each node, check its children. If a node only has a right child, then tle nodes are not as far left as possible, so return `false`. If a node doesn't have two children, then all the nodes after the node should be leaf nodes, or otherwise return `false`.

If there are less than 2<sup>h</sup> nodes in level h, then level h should be the last level and all the nodes in level h should be leaf nodes. If there exists a node that has at least one child, return `false`.

If no inconsistency found, return `true`.
