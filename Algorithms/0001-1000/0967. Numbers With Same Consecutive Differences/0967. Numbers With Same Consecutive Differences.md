# 967. Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences
## Level
Medium

## Description
Return all **non-negative** integers of length `N` such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `K`.

Note that **every** number in the answer **must not** have leading zeros **except** for the number `0` itself. For example, `01` has one leading zero and is invalid, but `0` is valid.

You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 3, K = 7

**Output:** [181,292,707,818,929]

**Explanation:** Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 2, K = 1

**Output:** [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= N <= 9`
2. `0 <= K <= 9`

## Solution
If `N` is 1, then the value of `K` does not affect the result since each integer has only one digit, and there are no two consecutive digits, so simply return an array that contains all the numbers from 0 to 9.

If `N >= 2`, then each number must not have leading zeros. Starting from 2 digits, obtain all the 2-digit numbers such that the difference between the two digits (which are obviously consecutive) is `K`. Then for `digits` from 3 to `N`, use the `digits - 1`-digit numbers to generate `digits`-digit numbers such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `K`. For each previous number, obtain the last digit from the previous number, and there are at most two numbers that can be generated from the previous number. If `K` is 0, then duplicates need to be avoided.

Finally, return all the `N`-digit numbers such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `K`.
