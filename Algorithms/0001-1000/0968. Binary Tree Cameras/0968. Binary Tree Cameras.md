# 968. Binary Tree Cameras
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor **its parent, itself, and its immediate children**.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [0,0,null,0,0]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
2. **Every** node has value 0.

## Solution
For each node, there may be three states.
* State 0 represents that all the nodes in the node's subtree are monitored, but the node is not monitored.
* State 1 represents that all the nodes in the node's subtree are monitored, including the node, but the node does not have a camera installed.
* State 2 represents that all the nodes in the node's subtree are monitored, and the node has a camera installed.

For each node, maintain an array of length 3, indicating the minimum number of cameras needed if the node is in each of the three states, respectively. This can be solved using a bottom-up approach.

Do breadth first search on the binary tree and use a list to store the nodes in the order that they are visited. Then loop over the list in reversing order. Use a map to store each node and the corresponding array.

If a node is a leaf node, then its corresponding array is `[0, INFINITY, 1]`, where `INFINITY` means that state 1 is impossible for the node.

If a node has only one child, suppose its child's array is `childArray`, then the node's corresponding array is `[childArray[1], childArray[2], 1 + min(childArray)]`.

If a node has two children, suppose its two children's arrays are `leftArray` and `rightArray` respectively, then the node's corresponding array is `[leftArray[1] + rightArray[1], min(leftArray[2] + minRight, rightArray[2] + minLeft), 1 + min(leftArray[0] + minLeft) + min(rightArray[0] + minRight)]`, where `minLeft = min(leftArray[1], leftArray[2])` and `minRight = min(rightArray[1], rightArray[2])`.

Finally, obtain the root's corresponding array `rootArray`, and return `min(rootArray[1], rootArray[2])`.
