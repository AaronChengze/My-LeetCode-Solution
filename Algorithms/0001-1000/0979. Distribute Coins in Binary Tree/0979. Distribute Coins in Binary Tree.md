# 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there are N coins total.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,0,0]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [0,3,0]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1,0,2]

**Output:** 2

**Example 4:**

**Input:** [1,0,0,null,3]

**Output:** 4

**Note:**

1. `1 <= N <= 100`
2. `0 <= node.val <= N`

## Solution
Since the total number of coins equals the total number of nodes in the binary tree, it is guaranteed that after several moves, each node has exactly one coin, so simply calculate the number of moves bottom-up. It is possible that at some points several nodes' numbers of coins may be negative, but each node's number of coins will eventually become 1, so the negative numbers of coins only mean that the order of moving should be changed and the number of moves in total is not affected.

Do breadth first search on the binary tree and add each node to a list. After searching, the list contains all the nodes in the binary tree in level order, and the last node in the list must be a leaf.

Loop over the list from the last node to the first node. For each node, check the numbers of coins of both children (only consider the children that are not `null`). If a child's value isn't equal to 1, then modify both the child's value and the current node's value such that the child's value becomes 1 and the sum of the current node's value and the child's value remains the same, and the current number of moves, which equals the absolute value of the difference of either node's current value and previous value, is added to the total number of moves.

Finally, return the total number of moves.
