# 986. Interval List Intersections
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two lists of **closed** intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

*(Formally, a closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`. The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]

**Output:** [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length < 1000`
2. `0 <= B.length < 1000`
3. `0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9`

## Solution
Since the two arrays `A` and `B` are already sorted, loop over the two arrays of intervals to obtain the intersections.

Use a list to store the intersections. Initialize `index1` and `index2` to be both 0. While `index1 < A.length` and `index2 < B.length`, obtain `interval1 = A[index1]` and `interval2 = B[index2]` and calculate the intersection of `interval1` and `interval2`. If the intersection is not empty, add the intersection to the list. Then move `index1` or `index2` or both indices forward by 1 step. If an interval has a smaller end value, move the corresponding index forward by 1 step. If both intervals have the same end value, move both indices forward by 1 step.

After all the intersections are obtained, use a 2D array to store the intersections and return.
