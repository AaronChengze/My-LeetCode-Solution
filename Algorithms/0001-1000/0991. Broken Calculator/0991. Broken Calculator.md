# 991. Broken Calculator
## Level
Medium

## Description
On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations:

* **Double:** Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
* **Decrement:** Subtract 1 from the number on the display.

Initially, the calculator is displaying the number `X`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number `Y`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** X = 2, Y = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** X = 5, Y = 8

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** X = 3, Y = 10

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**  Use double, decrement and double {3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10}.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** X = 1024, Y = 1

**Output:** 1023

**Explanation:** Use decrement operations 1023 times.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= X <= 10^9`
2. `1 <= Y <= 10^9`

## Solution
It is difficult to figure out how `X` becomes `Y` directly, but the problem can be solved in the opposite direction, which is try to make `Y` become `X` after some operations. To make `Y` become `X`, two operations are allowed. The first operation is half, which is divide `Y` by 2, which is only allowed when `Y` is even, and the second operation is increment, which is add 1 to `Y`, which is allowed for all values of `Y`.

When `X > Y` or `Y` is odd, obviously only increment can be used on `Y`. When `X < Y` and `Y` is even, both half and increment can be used on `Y`. Obviously using half costs fewer operations than using increment. Even if for the case where `X * 2 > Y` it is better to use half first, since using half first and increments next costs `1 + X - Y / 2` operations, and using increments and half first (first increase `Y` to `X * 2` then divide `Y` by 2) costs `X * 2 - Y + 1`, and obviously `1 + X - Y / 2 < X * 2 - Y + 1`.
