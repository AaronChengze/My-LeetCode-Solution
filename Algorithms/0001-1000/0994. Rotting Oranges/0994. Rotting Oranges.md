# 994. Rotting Oranges
## Level
Easy

## Description
In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

* the value `0` representing an empty cell;
* the value `1` representing a fresh orange;
* the value `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1` instead.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)

**Input:** [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]

**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [[0,2]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= grid.length <= 10`
2. `1 <= grid[0].length <= 10`
3. `grid[i][j]` is only `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Initially, offer the cells of rotton oranges into the queue. Each time a cell is polled from the queue, check the four adjacent cells. For each adjacent cell, if the cell contains a fresh orange, then change it into a rotten orange and update the number of minutes for the newly rotten orange. Repeat the procedure until no more fresh oranges can become rotten.

Check all the oranges. If there exists at least one fresh orange, return `-1`. Otherwise, return the maximum number of minutes among all the oranges (which is the minimum number of minutes that must elapse to make all oranges become rotten).
