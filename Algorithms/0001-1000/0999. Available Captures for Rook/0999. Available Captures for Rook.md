# 999. Available Captures for Rook
## Level
Easy

## Description
On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook.  There also may be empty squares, white bishops, and black pawns.  These are given as characters 'R', '.', 'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and lowercase characters represent black pieces.

The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it occupies.  Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.

Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

Explanation: 
The rook can capture the pawns at positions b5, d6 and f5.
```

**Note:**

1. `board.length == board[i].length == 8`
2. `board[i][j]` is either `'R'`, `'.'`, `'B'`, or `'p'`
3. There is exactly one cell with `board[i][j] == 'R'`

## Solution
First find the cell of the white rook `'R'`. Then consider all four directions. For each direction, find the furthest cell that the white rook can reach. If a black pawn is met, add the counter by 1 and stop moving in this direction further. If a white bishop or the side of the board is met, then stop moving in this direction further. Finally return the counter.
