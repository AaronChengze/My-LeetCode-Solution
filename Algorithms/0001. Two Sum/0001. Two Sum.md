#  1. Two Sum

## Level
Easy

## Description

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly*** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[**0**] + nums[**1**] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [**0**, **1**].

## Solution
Use a `Map` to record each number and the corresponding index of the number.
For an element in the array, if target minus element is already in the Map and the index of target minus element is smaller than the current index, then return the two indices as the answer.
