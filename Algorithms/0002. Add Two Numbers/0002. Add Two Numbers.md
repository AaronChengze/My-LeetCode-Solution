# 2. Add Two Numbers

## Level
Medium

## Description

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**

**Input:** (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
**Output:** 7 -> 0 -> 8
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

## Solution
Create a new list (with type `ListNode`) to store the sum of the two lists. Add the two lists position by position, and store the carry value  to the next position.
