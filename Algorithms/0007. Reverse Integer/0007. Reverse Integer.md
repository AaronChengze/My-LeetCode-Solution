# 7. Reverse Integer
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 123

**Output:** 321

**Example 2:**

**Input:** -123

**Output:** -321

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 120

**Output:** 21

**Note:**

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>-1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Solution
Since there are some cases that the reversed interger overflows, data type `long` should be used instead of `int`.

First, get the sign of the given integer, and get the absolute value of the given integer.

Next, deal with the absolute value of the given integer. Each time, get the last digit of the given integer and append the digit to the result integer, and remove the last digit of the given integer. These operations can be done by modulo, multiplication and division. The operations are finished when the given integer becomes 0.

Finally, add the sign of the given integer to the result integer, which can be done by multiplying by 1 or -1. If the result integer overflows (greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or less than `Integer.MIN_VALUE`), return 0. Otherwise, cast the result integer to data type `int` and return.
