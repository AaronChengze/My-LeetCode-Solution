# 9. Palindrome Number
## Level
Easy

## Description
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 121

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** -121

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 10

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Solution
Obviously, if the given integer is negative, then it can't be a palindrome since reading the number backward will result in the number ends with "-", so return `false` if the given integer is negative.

For a non-negative integer, to determine whether it is a palindrome, transfer it into a `String` or an array of type `char`, and use two pointers. Initially, the two pointers point to the begin and the end, and each time both pointers move towards the middle by one step until the pointers meet or cross each other. If at one step, the two characters that the two pointers point to are different, then return `false`. If the pointers meet or cross each other, then return `true`.
