# 14. Longest Common Prefix
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["flower","flow","flight"]

**Output:** "fl"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["dog","racecar","car"]

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:** There is no common prefix among the input strings.

**Note:**

All given inputs are in lowercase letters `a-z`.

## Solution
Use a variable to store the longest common prefix amongst all strings.
Initially, the longest common prefix equals the first string in the array. Next, get the longest common prefix between the previous longest common prefix and each string in the array.
