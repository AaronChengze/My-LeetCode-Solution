# 16. 3Sum Closest
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `nums` of *n* integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**

Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

## Solution
The solution is similar to the solution to problem 15. First, sort the array. Next, fix the leftmost number each time and find sums for all triplets, and update the closest sum.

Each time a leftmost number is fixed, use two pointers that are initially at two ends and move then towards the middle each time.

To avoid calculating on duplicates, if a number equals its previous number, then move forwards until the number doesn't equal its previous number.
