# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

**Example:**

**Input:** "23"

**Output:** ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

**Note:**

Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

## Solution
Use the idea of breadth first search. Loop over `digits` from left to right. For each digit, obtain the letters that the digit maps to, and for all previous strings, append each of the current letters to previous strings to form new strings.
