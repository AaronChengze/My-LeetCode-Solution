# 18. 4Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `nums` of *n* integers and an integer target, are there elements *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* in `nums` such that *a* + *b* + *c* + *d* = `target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of `target`.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

## Solution
The solution to 4Sum is similar to the solution to 3Sum. To solve 4Sum, each time fix the two leftmost indices, and use two pointers to find the other two numbers. The two pointers point to the start and the end initially, and move towards the middle.
