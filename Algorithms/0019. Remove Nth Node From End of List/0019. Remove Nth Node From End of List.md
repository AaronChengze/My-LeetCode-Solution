# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a linked list, remove the *n*-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

Given linked list: **1->2->3->4->5**, and ***n*** **= 2**.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes **1->2->3->5**.

**Note:**

Given *n* will always be valid.

**Follow up:**

Could you do this in one pass?

## Solution
A two-pass solution is quite simple. For the one-pass solution, two pointers are needed.

Create a `dummyHead` which is before `head`, that is, let `dummyHead.next = head`. Let `pointer1` and `pointer2` be two pointers. Initially, `pointer1` points to `dummyHead` and `pointer2` is `n` steps ahead of `pointer1`. Move `pointer1` and `pointer2` to the next step simultaneously until `pointer2` points to the last node, that is, when `pointer2.next == null` is true. At this time, `pointer1.next` is the node to be removed. Set `pointer1.next = pointer1.next.next` and return `dummyHead.next`.
