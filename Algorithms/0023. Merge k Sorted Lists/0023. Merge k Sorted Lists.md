# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists
## Level
Hard

## Description
Merge *k* sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

**Example:**
```
Input:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

## Solution
Create a `dummyHead` that occurs before the real head of the merged list. Use *k* pointers to point to the current numbers in each list. Each time, find the smallest number among the numbers that the *k* pointers point to, add the smallest number to the merged list, and move the corresponding pointer one step ahead. If a list's elements have all added to the merged list, then the lists' pointer points to the end, which is `null`, so skip the list when finding the smallest number in each iteration. Finally, return `dummyHead.next`.
