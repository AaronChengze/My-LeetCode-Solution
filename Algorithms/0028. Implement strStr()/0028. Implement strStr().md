# 28. Implement strStr()
## Level
Easy

## Description
Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"

**Output:** -1

**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [indexOf()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).

## Solution
Use the `indexOf` method directly can surely solve this problem, but this is meaningless.

There are several ways to do string matching. One way is the KMP algorithm. If using brute force approach, time complexity is rather high. The KMP algorithm calculates a prefix array to avoid unnecessary steps, which reduces time complexity.
