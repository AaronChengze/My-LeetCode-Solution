# 31. Next Permutation
## Level
Medium

## Description
Implement **next permutation**, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be **[in-place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

`1,2,3` ¡ú `1,3,2`
`3,2,1` ¡ú `1,2,3`
`1,1,5` ¡ú `1,5,1`

## Solution
To get the next permutation, the last ascending index needs to be obtained, which is the maximum `index` such that `nums[index] < nums[index + 1]`. If such an index doesn't exist, then the array is sorted in descending order, which is the last possible permutation, so sort the array in ascending order and return. If such an index exists, find the minimum number that is greater than the current number at position `index` and swap the two numbers, and then sort the numbers after position `index` to get the next permutation.
