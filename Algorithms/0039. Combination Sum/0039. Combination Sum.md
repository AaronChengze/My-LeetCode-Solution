# 39. Combination Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **set** of candidate numbers (`candidates`) **(without duplicates)** and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sums to `target`.

The **same** repeated number may be chosen from `candidates` unlimited number of times.

**Note:**

* All numbers (including `target`) will be positive integers.
* The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```

## Solution
Use backtrack. Keep two lists, one is the result combinations list which contains lists of combinations, and the other is the current combination list which contains numbers. Initially, both lists are empty.

Before do backtracking, sort the `candidates` array. Each time, select one number from the `candidates` and add it to the current combination, and the remaining target reduces by the selected number. If the remaining target is exactly zero at one step, then a combination is found and add the combination to the result combinations list.

To avoid duplicate combinations, do not select candidates before the current candidate. Also remember to remove the last candidate added after backtracking.
