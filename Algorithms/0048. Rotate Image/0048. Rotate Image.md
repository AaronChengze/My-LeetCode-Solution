# 48. Rotate Image
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an *n* x *n* 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

**Note:**

You have to rotate the image [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

**Example 1:**
```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
```

## Solution
To rotate the image by 90 degress clockwise, each time the elements are swapped in 4 corresponding positions. That is, if the 4 elements at the 4 positions are A, B, C, and D, then after swapping, the 4 elements at the 4 positions become D, A, B, and C.

Here define a "frame" to be a square with four sides only and all inner part removed. The outmost "frame" is the "frame" of the original images, and to move into an inner "frame", all 4 corners of the current "frame" move diagonally towards the center.

Starting from the outmost "frame". On the top row of the "frame", for each element, swap the elements at the 4 corresponding positions. After swapping is finished for a "frame", move into an inner "frame" and do swapping on the next "frame". Repeat the steps until swapping is finished for the innermost "frame".
