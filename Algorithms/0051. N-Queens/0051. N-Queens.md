Given an integer *n*, return all distinct solutions to the *n*-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the *n*-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

**Example:**
```
Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
```

## Solution
Use backtracking. Each time add one queen at each possible position in the current row such that the newly added queen won't attack any of the previous queens. Since one queen is added in one row each time, only the previously added queens need to be considered when adding a new queen.
