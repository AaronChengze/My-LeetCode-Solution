# 54. Spiral Matrix
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a matrix of *m* x *n* elements (*m* rows, *n* columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

## Solution
Starting from the top left corner and direction right, visit each element in spiral order. Use a 2D array of `boolean` type `visited` to record whether each cell is visited. Each time visit the current element, add the element to the result list and set the state of the current cell in `visited` to `true`. Then check the next cell using the current direction. If the next cell is out of the boundary or is already visited, then change to the next direction and move to the next cell using the new direction. Repeat the steps until all the cells are visited.
