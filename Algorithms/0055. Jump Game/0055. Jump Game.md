# 55. Jump Game
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [2,3,1,1,4]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,2,1,0,4]

**Output:** false

**Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

## Solution
This problem can be solved in another way. If the last index is to be reached, which is the minimum index that the jump starts?

Loop over the loop from the end to the begin. Use a variable `lastPos` to store the index that can reach the last index and was updated last. If indexA can reach the last position and indexB can reach indexA or a position on the right of indexA, then indexB can reach the last position as well. Use this rule to update `lastPos`.

Return `true` if and only if `lastPos == 0` after the loop.
