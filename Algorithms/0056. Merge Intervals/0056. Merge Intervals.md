# 56. Merge Intervals
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

**Output:** [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

**Explanation:** Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[1,4],[4,5]]

**Output:** [[1,5]]

**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

## Solution
First, sort the intervals according to the starts and then the ends.

Next, loop over the intervals and use a stack to store merged intervals.

For each interval, check the state of the stack. If the stack is empty or the interval at the stack's top does not overlap with the current interval, then push the current interval into the stack. If overlap occurs, check whether the current interval is completely contained in the previous interval (the previous interval is the interval at the stack's top), if it is not the case, then the two intervals need to be merged to create a new interval, pop the previous interval and push the new interval.

Finally, all the intervals in the stack are the intervals after merging. Use a 2D array to represent all the intervals and return.
