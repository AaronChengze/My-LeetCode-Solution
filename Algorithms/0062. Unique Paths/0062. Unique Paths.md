# 62. Unique Paths
## Level
Medium

## Description
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:

1. Right -> Right -> Down

2. Right -> Down -> Right

3. Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 7, n = 3

**Output:** 28

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. For each cell in the top row and the leftmost column, there is only 1 path to reach the cell. For other cells, a cell can be reached either from the cell above it or from the cell left to it, so the number of paths to reach the cell equals the number of paths to reach the cell above it plus the number of paths to reach the cell left to it. The number of paths to reach the cell at the bottom right corner can be obtained in this way.

Concretely, create a 2D array `counts` with *m* rows and *n* columns. For `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, there is `counts[i][0] = 1`. For `j` from `0` to `n - 1`, there is `counts[0][j] = 1`. When `i` and `j` are both greater than 0, `counts[i][j] = counts[i - 1][j] + counts[i][j - 1]`. Finally, return `counts[m - 1][n - 1]`, which is the answer.
