# 63. Unique Paths II
## Level
Medium

## Description
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Solution
The solution to this problem is similar to the solution to problem 62. Dynamic programming is also used in this solution. Since there are obstacles in this problem, the logic is a little different. If a cell has an obstacle, then the cell can't be reached and thus there are 0 ways to reach the cell. For the rest, the logic is the same as the solution to problem 62.
