# 64. Minimum Path Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a *m* x *n* grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which *minimizes* the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1->3->1->1->1 minimizes the sum.
```

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` that stores the minimum sum from the top left of `grid` to the current cell of `grid`.

Obviously, `dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]`. Since the move can only be down or right, for row 0 and column 0, the values in `dp` is decided by the previous `dp` value and the current `grid` value.

For the rest of the cells, suppose the current cell is in row `i` and column `j` where both `i` and `j` are greater than 0, `dp[i][j]` equals the minimum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]` plus `grid[i][j]`.

Finally, the bottom right element of `dp` is the minimum path sum from top left to bottom right.
