# 67. Add Binary
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both **non-empty** and contains only characters `1` or `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = "11", b = "1"

**Output:** "100"

**Example 2:**

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"

## Solution
First, make sure `a` has the length greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, then swap `a` and `b`.

Next, add the digits in `b` to the corresponding digits to `a`. It is possible that some digits in `a` exceeds `1`. In this case, add the carry to higher digits. If the sum has the same length as `a`, return the modified `a`. It is possible that the sum has a greater length than `a`. If the sum has a greater length, create a new string that stores the sum and return.
