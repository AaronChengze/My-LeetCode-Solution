# 69. Sqrt(x)
## Level
Easy

## Description
Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 4

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 8

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

## Solution
First deal with some small values of *x*. If *x* is less than 16, then the square root is from 0 to 3. Return the square root accordingly.

Next consider when *x* is greater than equal to 16. Use binary search. Initially, `low` equals 0 and `high` equals `x / 2` since when *x* is large enough, the square root of *x* must be less than half of *x*. The loop continues when `low <= high`. Each time set `mid` to be the average value of `low` and `high` and calculate the square of `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively. Let the square of `mid` be `square` and the square of `mid + 1` be `nextSquare`. If `square == x`, then `mid` is the square root, so return `mid`. If `square < x` and `nextSquare > x`, then `mid` is the integer part of `x`, so also return `mid`. For other cases, adjust `high` or `low` accordingly.
