# 70. Climbing Stairs
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given *n* will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step

2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step

2. 1 step + 2 steps

3. 2 steps + 1 step

## Solution
This problem is almost the same as Fibonacci sequence. The number of ways for *n* steps is determined by the number of ways for *n* - 1 steps and the number of ways for *n* - 2 steps.

Start from 1 steps and 2 steps. If *n* is 1, then there is 1 way. If *n* is 2, then there are 2 ways.

For greater *n*, the top, which is position *n*, can be reached by 1 step from position *n* - 1, or can be reached by 2 steps from position *n* - 2. So the number of ways for *n* steps equals the number of ways for *n* - 1 steps plus the number of ways for *n* - 2 steps.

Thus the problem can be solved using iteration.
