# 76. Minimum Window Substring
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

**Input:** **S** = "ADOBECODEBANC", **T** = "ABC"

**Output:** "BANC"

**Note:**

* If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.
* If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

## Solution
Use sliding window. Suppose the sliding window in `s` has start index `startIndex` inclusive and end index `endIndex` exclusive. Initially, `startIndex` is 0. Find the minimum `endIndex` such that the sliding window in `s` contains all the letters in `t`, and update the minimum window size and the minimum window's start index and end index. Then move `startIndex` to the right by one step each time and update the minimum window's information, until the sliding window no longer contains all the characters in `t`. Then move `endIndex` to the right to find the next sliding window that contains all the characters in `t`. Repeat the process until the end of `s` is met. Finally, use the minimum window's start index and end index to return the minimum window in `s`.
