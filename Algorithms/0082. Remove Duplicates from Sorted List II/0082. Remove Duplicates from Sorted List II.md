# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only *distinct* numbers from the original list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1->2->3->3->4->4->5

**Output:** 1->2->5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 1->1->1->2->3

**Output:** 2->3

## Solution
To remove all notes that have duplicate numbers, the current node's value should be stored, and the next node's value should also be stored. If the current node's value and the next node's value are different, then there is nothing to do with the current node, so move one step forward. Otherwise, the current node should be deleted, so find the first node that has a different value, and set the previous node's next to the first node with a different value.
