## Level
Hard

## Description
Given *n* non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = `[2,1,5,6,2,3]`.

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = `10` unit.

**Example:**

**Input:** [2,1,5,6,2,3]

**Output:** 10

## Solution
Loop over `heights` from left to right. For each `height` in `heights`, let `height` be the leftmost bar of the current rectangle, and try all possible rectangles to find the maximum area. Then store the final remaining height as `maxHeight`. For the next `height` in `heights`, if `height` is less than or equal to `maxHeight`, then it is not possible to have a rectangle that has a greater area than the current largest area, so continue. If `height` is greater than `maxHeight`, then find the maximum area as before.

Finally, return the largest area.
