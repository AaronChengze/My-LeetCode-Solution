# 85. Maximal Rectangle
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:

Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
```

## Solution
Loop over each cell in `matrix` and for each cell that has value 1, find the maximum area of the rectangle that has the cell as the top left corner.

When a cell is used as the top left corner of a rectangle, the rectangle's width and height are both initially 1, and the maximum width and the maximum height are initially the maximum values to the bottom and to the right. For each row, calculate the maximum width that contains all 1's, update the maximum area and update the maximum width. In the following rows, only check the cells that do not exceed the updated maximum width.

Finally, return the maximum area.
