# 86. Partition List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a linked list and a value *x*, partition it such that all nodes less than *x* come before nodes greater than or equal to *x*.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example:**

**Input:** head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3

**Output:** 1->2->2->4->3->5

## Solution
Loop over the list once. Use two pointers `leftLast` and `rightFirst` to represent the last node in the partitioned list that has a value less than `x` and the first node in the partitioned list that has a value greater than or equal to `x`, respectively.

Initially, `leftLast` points to `head`. Each time when `leftLast.next` has a value less than `x`, move `leftLast` to the next position. For the first time that `leftLast.next` has a value greater than or equal to `x`, set `rightFirst` to be `leftLast.next`. Then loop over from the next node of `rightFirst` to the end. If the node has a value less than `x`, then set the node to be the next node of `leftLast` and move `leftLast` to the next position.

Finally, let `leftLast.next` point to `rightFirst`.
