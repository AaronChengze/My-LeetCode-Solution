# 93. Restore IP Addresses
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.

**Example:**

**Input:** "25525511135"

**Output:** ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]

## Solution
Since an IP address consists of four numbers, try all possible ways to split `s` into four parts. If all four parts are integers in the range `[0, 255]`, then it is a valid IP address combination, and add the IP to the result list.
