# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the *inorder* traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,3,2]
```
**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Solution
To obtain inorder traversal iteratively, a stack needs to be used.

The order of nodes to be visited is left subtree, root and right subtree. First, find the leftmost node, and push all the nodes in the path into the stack, until the current node does not have a left child. Next, add the leftmost node's value to the list, and move to the leftmost node's right child, which will be visited next if not `null`.

After the leftmost node is visited and possibly its right child is visited, the subtree whose root is the leftmost node is visited completely, and its parent is the next node to be visited. For the rest of the nodes, the logic is the same. If a node doesn't have a left child or its left child has already been visited, visit this node and its right child, until all the nodes in the subtree are visited.
