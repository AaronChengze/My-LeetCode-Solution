# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree
## Level
Hard

## Description
Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
```
**Follow up:**

* A solution using O(*n*) space is pretty straight forward.
* Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Solution
The solution is to use the idea of inorder traversal. Since the inorder traversal of a binary search tree contains all the values in ascending order, the two elements swapped can be determined.

To obtain a constant space solution, use Morris Traversal.
