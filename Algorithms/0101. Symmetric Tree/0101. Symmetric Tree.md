# 101. Symmetric Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

**Note:**

Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

## Solution
If the root only has one child, or the root has two children but the two children have different values, return `false`.

Use two queues, which search the left subtree and the right subtree of the root respectively. Do breadth first search on the two subtrees simultaneously, starting from the roots of both subtrees. For the left subtree, always search from left to right. For the right subtree, always search from right to left.

If the binary tree is symmetric, at each step, the nodes visited in both subtrees should have the same value. If at one step, the nodes visited in the two subtrees have different values, or exactly one subtree's visited node is `null`, then the binary tree is not symmetric and return `false`. If after search is finished and no difference found, then the binary trees is symmetric and return `true`.
