# 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the *level order* traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```

## Solution
To traverse a tree in level order, use breadth first search. A queue is used to store the nodes to be visited next. Initially, the root is offered to the queue.

Each time, obtain the size of the queue, which is the number of nodes in the current value. For the current level, use a list to store the nodes' values, poll each node and add the value to the list, and offer the node's left child and right child to the queue if the child exists. After a level is traversed, add the level's list to the result list.
