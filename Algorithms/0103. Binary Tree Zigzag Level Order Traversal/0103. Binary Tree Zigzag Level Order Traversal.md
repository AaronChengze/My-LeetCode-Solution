# 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the *zigzag level order* traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its zigzag level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
```

## Solution
This problem is similar to problem 102, with the difference that in this problem, the binary tree is traversed in zigzag level order.

The solution to this problem is also similar to problem 102, with the difference that at each level, the order whether the nodes are traversed from left to right or from right to left should be determined. If a level should be traversed from right to left, then for the list of the current level, reverse the order of values added to the list.
