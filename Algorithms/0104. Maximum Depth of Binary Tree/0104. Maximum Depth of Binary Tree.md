# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its depth = 3.

## Solution
For an empty tree, the depth is 0. For a tree that contains only one node, the depth is 1. Return the depth directly for the two cases.

Do breadth first search on the tree and record the depth of each node. The root node has depth 1. Use two queues to store nodes and depths of nodes. Initially, offer the root and depth 1 to the two queues respectively. Each time a node and its depth are polled from the queues, find the two children of the node, and offer each child and a greater depth to the two queues if the child is not `null`.

Finally, return the maximum depth among all nodes.
