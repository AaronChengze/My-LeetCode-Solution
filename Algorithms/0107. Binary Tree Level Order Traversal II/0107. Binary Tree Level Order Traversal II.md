# 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the *bottom-up level order* traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its level order traversal as:
```
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
```

## Solution
Similar to problem 102, this problem can also be solved using breadth first search. Since this problem requires bottom-up level order traversal, the result list should contain the lists of each level in the reverse order. Therefore, after a level is traversed, add the list of the current level to the beginning of the result list.
