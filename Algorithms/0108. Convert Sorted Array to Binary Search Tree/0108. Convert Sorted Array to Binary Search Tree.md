# 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**
```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

## Solution
This problem can be solved in several ways. To generate a height balanced binary search tree, use the value in the middle to create the root, so that the numbers of nodes in the two subtrees at most differ by 1. For the roots of the left subtree and the right subtree, generate subtrees that are binary search tree in the same way.

Other solutions like AVL tree or red-black tree can also be used.
