# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**
```
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

## Solution
The solution is similar to the solution to problem 108. First, find the value in the middle of the list and use this value to create the root, so that the numbers of nodes in the two subtrees at most differ by 1. For the roots of the left subtree and the right subtree, generate subtrees that are binary search tree in the same way.

To find the value in the middle, use two pointers `fast` and `slow`. Each time `fast` moves 2 steps and `slow` moves 1 step. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` points to the middle of the list.

Other solutions like AVL tree or red-black tree can also be used.
