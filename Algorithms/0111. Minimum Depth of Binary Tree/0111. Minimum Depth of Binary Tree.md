# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its minimum depth = 2.

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Use two queues to store nodes and corresponding depths respectively. Initially, offer the root and depth 1 to the two queues respectively, since the root has depth 1. During the search, for each node, record its depth. If a node has no children, then the node is a leaf, so update the minimum depth.
