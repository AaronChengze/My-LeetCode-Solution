# 112. Path Sum
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,
```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.

## Solution
Use recursion.

If root is `null`, then return false since there is no such a path.

If root is leaf (root has no children), then return true if and only if root's value equals `sum`.

Otherwise, let `remain` be `root.val - sum` and consider the root's children, and return `true` if at least one child's root-to-leaf path should have all values's equals `remain`.
