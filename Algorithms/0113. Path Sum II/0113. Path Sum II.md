# 113. Path Sum II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,
```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```
Return:
```
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```

## Solution
Use recursion.
If root is `null`, then return an empty list since there is no such a path.
If root is leaf (root has no children), then if root's value equals `sum`, return a list which contains a list that has size 1 (the root's value is in the inner list), otherwise return an empty list.
Otherwise, let `remain` be `root.val - sum` and consider the root's children, and apply `remain` as `sum` for the children. If there is at least one path for a children, then add the root's value to the list at the beginning position.
