# 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```
The flattened tree should look like:
```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

## Solution
The way the binary tree is flattened is to flatten the binary tree so that the order of nodes are the same as the preorder traversal.

Starting from the root, for each node, check whether it has a left child. If the node doesn't have a left child, then its next node is naturally its right child, so no modification is needed. If the node has a left child, then the next node should be the left child. The node's previous right child becomes the right child of the node's predecessor (the predecessor of a node is the rightmost node in the current node's left subtree). Set the node's right child to be the next node, which is the node's left child before modification. Set the node's left child to null so that the tree is flattened.

Repeat such procedure until all nodes are visited and modified if necessary.
