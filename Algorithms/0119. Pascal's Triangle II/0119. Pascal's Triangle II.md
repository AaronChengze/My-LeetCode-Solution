# 119. Pascal's Triangle II
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a non-negative index *k* where *k* â‰¤ 33, return the *k*<sup>th</sup> index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

**Example:**
```
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

**Follow up:**

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(*k*) extra space?

## Solution
Similar to problem 118, this problem is also about Pascal's Triangle. Since this problem only requires returning the *k*<sup>th</sup> index row of the Pascal's triangle, a solution to reduce time complexity and space complexity is to use formula to calculate the values in the row.

In Pascal's Triangle, the *k*<sup>th</sup> index row contains *k*+1 numbers (*k* starts from 0), where the leftmost number and the rightmost number are 1. In the *k*<sup>th</sup> index row, the number at index *m* is *C*(*k*, *m*), where *C* stands for combination, for example, *C*(5, 2) = 10. Another thing that can be used to optimize is that *C*(*k*, *m*) = *C*(*k*, *k* - *m*), so just calculate the left half of the row, and the right half of the row can be obtained by copying the values in the left half of the row.
