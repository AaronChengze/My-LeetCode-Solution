## Description
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
```
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., **2** + **3** + **5** + **1** = 11).

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(*n*) extra space, where *n* is the total number of rows in the triangle.

## Solution
This problem can be solved using top-down approach or bottom-up approach. To use only O(*n*) extra space, the bottom-up approach is preferred.

Each number in the triangle corresponds to a minimum path sum from the bottom to the current number. Initially, the bottom row's minimum path sums are equal to the numbers in the triangle's bottom row.

For each upper row, the minimum path sum of a number equals the minimum path sum of the two adjacent numbers in the lower row plus the current number in the upper row.

When calculation reaches the top row, the minimum path sum from top to bottom is obtained.

The bottom-up approach only stores the numbers in each row at a time, so the space compexity is O(*n*).
