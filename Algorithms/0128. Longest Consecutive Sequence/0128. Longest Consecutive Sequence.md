# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(*n*) complexity.

**Example:**

**Input:** [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

## Solution
Use a hash set so that the runtime complexity is O(*n*). Store all the numbers in `nums` into the hash set. Then for each `num` in `nums`, if `num - 1` is not in the hash set, `num` is the first number if a consecutive elements sequence. Find the maximum number `k` such that all the integers from `num` to `num + k - 1` is in the hash set, and update the maximum length using `k` if the maximum length is less than `k`. Finally, return the maximum length.
