# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree containing digits from `0-9` only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number `123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

## Solution
If the binary tree is empty, return 0.

Use breadth first search. Starting from the root, for each node, check the two children. If both children are `null`, then the node is a leaf, so add the current value to the sum. Otherwise, for each child that is not `null`, update the child's value to be a number with one more digit, and the child will be visited during the search.
