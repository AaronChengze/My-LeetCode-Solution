# 132. Palindrome Partitioning II
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string *s*, partition *s* such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of *s*.

**Example:**

**Input:** "aab"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.

## Solution
First determine whether each substring of *s* is a palindrome. This can be done by using the solution to problem 5.

To find the minimum cuts needed, use dynamic programming. Suppose the length of *s* is `length`. Create an array `dp` of length `length`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partition of `s.substring(0, i + 1)`. Iniialize `dp[i] = i` for all `0 <= i < length`, since cutting between each pair of letters results in the maximum possible cuts. If `s.substring(0, i + 1)` is a palindrome, then set `dp[i]` to 0 since no cuts is needed for a palindrome. In other cases, for all `j` such that `0 < j <= i` and `s.substring(j, i + 1)` is a palindrome, update `dp[i]`as the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j - 1] + 1`. Finally, return `dp[length - 1]`.
