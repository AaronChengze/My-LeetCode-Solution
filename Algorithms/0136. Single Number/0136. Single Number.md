# 136. Single Number
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [2,2,1]

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [4,1,2,1,2]

**Output:** 4

## Solution
Use bitwise XOR operation. For any number `num`, the result of `num ^ num` is always 0. Also the order of the numbers in the bitwise XOR operation doesn't affect the result. So do bitwise XOR operations on all the numbers, and the result is the single number.
