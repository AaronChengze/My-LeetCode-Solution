# 137. Single Number II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *three* times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [2,2,3,2]

**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]

**Output:** 99

## Solution
Since each number appears three times except for one, check whether each bit has 1 occurred for 1 time or 2 times.

Use two integers `ones` and `twos` to represent whether each bit has 1 occurred for 1 time or 2 times. Each time a number is visited, update `ones` and `twos` accordingly. For each bit, `ones` and `twos` are updated only if `num` is 1. Initially, both `ones` and `twos` are 0. For the first 1, `ones` becomes 1 and `twos` remains 0. For the second 1, `ones` becomes 0 and `twos` becomes 1. For the third 1, both `ones` and `twos` become 0. Use bitwise operations to manipulate this.

Finally, return `ones`, which represents the single number.
