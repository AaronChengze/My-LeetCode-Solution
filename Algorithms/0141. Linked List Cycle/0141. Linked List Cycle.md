# 141. Linked List Cycle
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solution
Use two pointers `fast` and `slow` that both point to `head` initially. Each time, `fast` moves two steps forward and `slow` moves one step forward. If at one point `fast` reaches the end of the list, then there is no cycle in the list, so return `false`.

If there is a cycle in the list, it is guaranteed that the two pointers will meet at some point, and when a meeting point is found, return `true`.
