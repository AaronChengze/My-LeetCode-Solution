# 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the *preorder* traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,2,3]
```
**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Solution
To obtain preorder traversal iteratively, a stack needs to be used.
The order of nodes to be visited is root, left subtree and right subtree. First, push the root into the stack. Next, perform preorder traversal starting with the stack which contains only the root node. Each time, pop a node from the stack and add its value to the list, and obtain its two children. Push each child into the stack if the child is not `null`, and push the right child into the stack before the left child if both children are not `null`. The reason why the right child is pushed into the stack before the left child is that preorder traversal visits the left subtree before the right subtree, and the last element pushed into the stack will be popped out first.

According to the procedure, for each subtree, the root is visited first, and all nodes in the left subtree are visited before any node in the right subtree.
