# 151. Reverse Words in a String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "the sky is blue"

**Output:** "blue is sky the"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "  hello world!  "

**Output:** "world! hello"

**Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "a good   example"

**Output:** "example good a"

**Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Note:**

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Follow up:**

For C programmers, try to solve it *in-place* in O(1) extra space.

## Solution
First, remove leading and trailing spaces, and remove multiple spaces between two words.

Secondly, split the string by spaces to form an array, each element of which is a word in the string.

Thirdly, from the last word to the first word, each time append a word to the new string. The words should be split by spaces.

Finally, return the new string.
