# 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,3,5]

Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [2,2,2,0,1]

**Output:** 0

**Note:**

* This is a follow up problem to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/).
* Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## Solution
First consider some simple cases. If there is only one element, then return the element. If there are only two elements then return the minimum between the two elements. If the first element is less than the last element, then the array is not rotated, so return the first element, which is the element at index 0.

For the rest cases, use recursion to find the minimum. Each time restrict the lower bound and the upper bound of the indices for searching. If the lower bound equals the upper bound, then return the number at the index. If the upper bound and the lower bound differ by 1, then return the minimum of the two numbers at the lower bound and the upper bound. Otherwise, split the array into two parts and do the search at both sides to find the minimum.
