# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string ***s***, find the length of the longest substring ***t*** that contains **at most** 2 distinct characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "eceba"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** t is "ece" which its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "ccaabbb"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** t is "aabbb" which its length is 5.

## Solution
If the length of string `s` is less than or equal to 2, then simply return `s.length()` since there can't be more than 2 distinct characters in `s`.

Use a `Map` to store each character and its number of occurrences. Loop over the string `s` once from left to right, and use two pointers `start` and `end` to represent the start index and the end index of the current substring. For each character, increase its number of occurrences by 1 in the `Map` and move `end` one step forward. If at one step, the `Map` contains more than 2 keys, then the current substring contains more than 2 distinct characters, so decrease the number of occurrences of the character at index `start` by 1, and move `start` one step forward, and if the number of occurrences of a character becomes 0, then remove the character from the `Map`. The process is repeated until the `Map` contains no more than 2 keys. At each step, update the maximum length of the substring that has at most two distinct characters. Finally, return the maximum length.
