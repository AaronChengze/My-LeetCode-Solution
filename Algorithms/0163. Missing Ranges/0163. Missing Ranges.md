# 163. Missing Ranges
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a sorted integer array ***nums***, where the range of elements are in the **inclusive range** **[** ***lower*****,** ***upper*** **]**, return its missing ranges.

**Example:**

**Input:** ***nums*** = [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], ***lower*** = 0 and ***upper*** = 99,

**Output:** ["2", "4->49", "51->74", "76->99"]

## Solution
The solution seems to be quite intuitive. Since the array is sorted, just traverse through the array to find the missing numbers or ranges. However, there are some points that need to pay attention to.

If the array is empty, then the whole range is missing, so return the whole range.

For the intermediate numbers in the array, just compare each number to the adjacent numbers to find whether zero, one or several numbers are missing, and add the one number or the range to the result list. However, the first number and the last number in the array should be compared to the lower bound and the upper bound respectively, and if there is a missing range, the lower bound or the upper bound should be included in the missing range.

Another point to pay attention to is the upper bound and the lower bound of the `int` type. If `-2147483648` and `2147483647` are in the array, or are the lower bound and the upper bound respectively, then the difference between two numbers may be larger than what an `int` type variable can present, so use `long` type when necessary.
