# 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer *n*, return the number of trailing zeroes in *n*!.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 3

**Output**: 0

**Explanation:** 3! = 6, no trailing zero.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 5

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** 5! = 120, one trailing zero.

**Note:** Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

## Solution
A factor 10 adds one trailing zero. Since 10 = 2 * 5, the number of factors 2 and the number of factors 5 need to be calculated. For any *n*, its factorial *n*! contains more factors that contain 2 than factors that contain 5, so only factors that contain 5 need to be calculated.

Each multiple of 5 contains one factor 5. Each multiple of 25 contains two factors 5. Each multiple of 125 contains three factors 5. Likewise, there are also multiples thant contain more factors 5. Therefore, calculate the number of factors 5 from 1 to *n*, which represents the number of trailing zeroes in *n*!.
