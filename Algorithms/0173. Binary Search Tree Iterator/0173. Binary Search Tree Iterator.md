# 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator
## Level
Medium

## Description
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling `next()` will return the next smallest number in the BST.

**Example:**

```
BSTIterator iterator = new BSTIterator(root);
iterator.next();    // return 3
iterator.next();    // return 7
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 9
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 15
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 20
iterator.hasNext(); // return false
```

**Note:**

* `next()` and `hasNext()` should run in average O(1) time and uses O(*h*) memory, where *h* is the height of the tree.
* You may assume that `next()` call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when `next()` is called.

## Solution
A straightforward solution is to obtain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree, which contains all the numbers in the binary search tree in ascending order. However, this will use O(*n*) memory instead of O(*h*) memory, where *n* is the number of nodes of the tree and *h* is the height of the tree.

To use O(*h*) memory, use a stack instead. Initially, push the root into the stack, and as long as the node at the top of the stack has a non-empty left child, push the left child into the stack. The bottom-left node will be the last node that is pushed into the stack, which has the minimum number.

To obtain the next smallest number, pop the top node from the stack and obtain its number, and if the popped node has a right child, push the right child into the stack. Return the number of the popped node.

To determine whether there is a next number, simply check whether the stack contains at least one node.

The method `hasNext()` runs in O(1) time obviously. The time complexity of method `next()` is not quite intuitive. Although pushing nodes starting from the right child may have time complexity greater than O(1), it is not always the case that there is a right child, so the average time complexity is O(1).
