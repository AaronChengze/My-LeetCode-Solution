# 179. Largest Number
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [10,2]

**Output:** "210"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,30,34,5,9]

**Output:** "9534330"

**Note:** The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

## Solution
First, sort the array in an order as follows. Let `num1` and `num2` be the string versions of two numbers from the array. We have `num1` before `num2` if and only if `num1.concat(num2)` is greater than `num2.concat(num1)` when using `compareTo` method. For example, "2" is before "10" since "210" is greater than "102".

Next, concatenate the numbers in the sorted order. The number formed in such a way is the largest number.
