# 200. Number of Islands
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Initially, all cells that are land are unvisited. Loop over the map. Each time an unvisited land cell is met, do breadth first search starting from the cell, and set all the cells that are reachable from the starting cell to be visited, including the starting cell. After the current search is finished, add the number of islands by 1. If a land cell that has already been visited is met, then skip the cell since it belongs to a previous island. After all the land cells are visited, return the number of islands.
