# 202. Happy Number
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:**

**Input:** 19

**Output:** true

Explanation:

1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82

8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68

6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100

1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1

## Solution
Use a set to store the numbers that has been reached. Start from the given number and add the number to the set. At each step, get the next number according to the process, and add the next number to the set.

If at a step, the number equals 1 or the number is already in the set, break the loop.

Return `true` if and only if the number ends in 1.
