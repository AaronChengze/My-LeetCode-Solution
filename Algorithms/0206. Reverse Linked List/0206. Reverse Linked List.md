# 206. Reverse Linked List
## Level
Easy

## Description
Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

**Input:** 1->2->3->4->5->NULL

**Output:** 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Solution
The recursive solution is to do the reverse operation for `head.next`, and set `head.next.next = head` and `head.next = null`.

The iterative solution uses two pointers, `prev` and `curr`. Initially, `prev` is `null` and `curr` points to `head`. Each step, let `nextTemp` be the next node of `curr` before reversing `curr`. Set `curr.next = prev`. After that, set both `prev` and `curr` to the next step (that is, `prev = curr` and `curr = nextTemp`). The loop ends when all nodes in the original list are reversed.
