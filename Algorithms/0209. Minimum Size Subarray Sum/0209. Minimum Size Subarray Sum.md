# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s**, find the minimal length of a **contiguous** subarray of which the sum >= **s**. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

**Example:**

**Input:** s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(*n*) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(*n* log *n*). 

## Solution
Use two pointers `left` and `right` that both point to 0 initially. Each time add the number at index `right` into the subarray. If the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to `s`, then update the minimum subarray size. While the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to `s`, move `left` forward by 1 step and reduce the minimum subarray size, and update the minimum subarray size. Then move `right` forward by 1 step and continue the steps.

Finally, return the minimum subarray size.
