# 211. Add and Search Word - Data structure design
## Level
Medium

## Description
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
```
void addWord(word)
bool search(word)
```
`search(word)` can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters `a-z` or `.`. A `.` means it can represent any one letter.

**Example:**
```
addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true
```

**Note:**

You may assume that all words are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.

## Solution
Use a trie to implement the data structure. The solution is similar to the solution to problem 208. The constructor and the `addWord` method are exactly the same as the constructor and the `insert` method in the solution to problem 208. The `search` method is similar to the `search` method in problem 208, but with some difference since `.` is introduced here.

In `search`, use a queue to store trie nodes. For each character in `word`, if it is a `.`, then offer the trie nodes of  all possible next letters to the queue. Otherwise, check the corresponding element in the node's next nodes, and offer non-null nodes to the queue. Finally, if a node has `wordEnd == true` is met, return `true`. If not found, return `false`.
