# 212. Word Search II
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
board = [
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]

Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

**Note:**

1. All inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.
2. The values of `words` are distinct.

## Solution
The solution to problem 79 can be reused here. Just search for each `word` in `words` and check whether it exists, and add the words that exist to the result list.

There also exist other solutions like trie.
