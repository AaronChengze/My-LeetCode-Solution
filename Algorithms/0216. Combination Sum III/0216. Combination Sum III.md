# 216. Combination Sum III
## Level
Medium

## Description
Find all possible combinations of ***k*** numbers that add up to a number ***n***, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

**Note:**

* All numbers will be positive integers.
* The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 7

**Output:** [[1,2,4]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 9

**Output:** [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]

## Solution
Similar to the previous two combination sum problems, this problem can still be solved using backtrack. Keep two lists, one is the result combinations list which contains lists of combinations, and the other is the current combination list which contains numbers. Initially, both lists are empty.

In this problem, only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used, and each combination should be a unique set of numbers, so the number of possible combinations is limited.

Each time, add one number `i` to the current combination, while `k` becomes `k - 1` and `n` becomes `n - i` for recursion, and only the numbers greater than `i` can be used next. If both `k` and `n` are exactly zero at one step, then a combination is found and add the combination to the result combinations list.
