## Description
Given an array of integers and an integer *k*, find out whether there are two distinct indices *i* and *j* in the array such that **nums[i] = nums[j]** and the **absolute** difference between *i* and *j* is at most *k*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1

**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2

**Output:** false

## Solution
Use a `Map` to store each number and the last index at which the number occurred. Loop over the array from left to right. At each index, obtain the number at the current index and find the last index of the number. If the number has already occurred before and the difference between the current index and the previous index is less than or equal to *k*, then return `true`. If there isn't such a number that has its two occurrences differing by *k* at most, then return `false`.
