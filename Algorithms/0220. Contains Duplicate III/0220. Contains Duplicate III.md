## Description
Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices *i* and *j* in the array such that the **absolute** difference between **nums[i]** and **nums[j]** is at most *t* and the **absolute** difference between *i* and *j* is at most *k*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2

**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3

**Output:** false

## Solution
For each start index from 0 to `nums.length - 1`, find the end index which is the minimum of *k* steps after the start index and `nums.length - 1`. Calculate the absolute difference between each element in the range with the element at the start index. If there is an absolute difference less than or equal to *k*, then return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
