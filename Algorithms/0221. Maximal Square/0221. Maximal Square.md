# 221. Maximal Square
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

**Example:**
```
Input: 

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Output: 4
```

## Solution
Loop over each cell in `matrix` and for each cell that has value 1, find the maximum side length of the square that has the cell as the top left corner.

When a cell is used as the top left corner of a square, the square's side length is initially 1. Each time increase the side length by 1 and check the cells newly added to the square. If all of the newly added cells have value 1, then the new square is valid, so update the maximum side length of the square. Otherwise, the new square is invalid, and for any square that has the same top left corner and has greater side length, it can't be valid, so move to the next cell as the top left corner of a square.

Finally, calculate the maximum area using the maximum side length, and return the maximum area.
