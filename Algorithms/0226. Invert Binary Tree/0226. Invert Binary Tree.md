## Level
Easy

## Description
Invert a binary tree.

**Example:**

```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```

Trivia:
This problem was inspired by [this original tweet](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768) by [Max Howell](https://twitter.com/mxcl):

> Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can¡¯t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

## Solution
Do breadth first search starting from the root. For each node visited, obtain its left child and right child, and swap the two children. That is, for `node` that is visited currently, let its left child and right child are `left` and `right` respectively, and set `node.left = right` and `node.right = left`. Note that the references are swapped, not the values of the children are swapped. Then offer `right` and `left` to the queue for the next step's search. Finally, return the root.
