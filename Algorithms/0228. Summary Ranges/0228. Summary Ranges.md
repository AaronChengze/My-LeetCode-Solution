# 228. Summary Ranges
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a sorted integer array without duplicates, return the summary of its ranges.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  [0,1,2,4,5,7]

**Output:** ["0->2","4->5","7"]

**Explanation:** 0,1,2 form a continuous range; 4,5 form a continuous range.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]

**Output:** ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]

**Explanation:** 2,3,4 form a continuous range; 8,9 form a continuous range.

## Solution
Since the array is sorted, just traverse through the array. If adjacent numbers differ by 1, then continue to find the complete range. Otherwise, the previous range ends and update the range.

The number range of the `int` type should be paid attention to. If `-2147483648` and `2147483647` are in the array, then the difference between two numbers may be larger than what an `int` type variable can present, so use `long` type when necessary.
