# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5

**Output:** [4,1,9]

**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1

**Output:** [4,5,9]

**Explanation:** You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Note:**

* The linked list will have at least two elements.
* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
* Do not return anything from your function.

## Solution
Since only access to the node to be deleted is given, its previous node can't be accessed, so the node can't be deleted directly. The solution is to remove the node's next node, and set the node's value as its next node's value.

Suppose the node to be deleted is `a`, which is not the tail of the list, its next node is `b`. To delete `a`, the operation is as follows. Set `a.val = b.val`, and set `a.next = b.next`. After such an operation, the previous value of `a` does not exist in the list, so it is deleted.
