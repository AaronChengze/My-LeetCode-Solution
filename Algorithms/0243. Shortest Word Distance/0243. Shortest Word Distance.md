# 243. Shortest Word Distance
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a list of words and two words *word1* and *word2*, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

**Input:** *word1* = "coding", *word2* = "practice"

**Output:** 3

**Input:** *word1* = "makes", *word2* = "coding"

**Output:** 1

**Note:**

You may assume that *word1* **does not equal to** *word2*, and *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.

## Solution
Since *word1* and *word2* are both in the list, a straightforward solution is to store all indices of *word1* and all indices of *word2*. After obtaining the indices of both words, calculate the difference between the indices of *word1* and *word2* (the difference should be the absolute value), and return the minimum difference.
