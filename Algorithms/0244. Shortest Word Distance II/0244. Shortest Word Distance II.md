# 244. Shortest Word Distance II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words *word1* and *word2* and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called *repeatedly* many times with different parameters.Â 

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

**Input:** *word1* = "coding", *word2* = "practice"

**Output:** 3

**Input:** *word1* = "makes", *word2* = "coding"

**Output:** 1

**Note:**

You may assume that *word1* **does not equal to** *word2*, and *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.

## Solution
This is a follow-up problem of problem 243, and the difference is that in this problem, the method will be called repeatedly many times.

The solution is that in the constructor, store all the indices of each word. This can be done by using a `Map`. Then when calling the method, just get the two words' indices, calculate the difference between the indices of two words, and return the minimum difference.
