# 248. Strobogrammatic Number III
## Level
Hard

## Description
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

**Example:**

**Input:** low = "50", high = "100"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.

**Note:**

Because the range might be a large number, the *low* and *high* numbers are represented as string.

## Solution
First check the lengths of `low` and `high` respectively, and find all strobogrammatic numbers in range `[low.length(), high.length()]`. To find strobogrammatic numbers with length `n`, use the solution in problem 247.

Then use binary search to find the indices of `low` and `high` in the list of the strobogrammatic numbers. The number of strobogrammatic numbers in the range can be obtained.
