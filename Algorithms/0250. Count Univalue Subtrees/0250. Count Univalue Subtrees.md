# 250. Count Univalue Subtrees
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, count the number of uni-value subtrees.

A Uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

**Example:**
```
Input:  root = [5,1,5,5,5,null,5]

              5
             / \
            1   5
           / \   \
          5   5   5

Output: 4
```

## Solution
Use recursion. If a binary tree is empty, it is not a uni-value tree. If a binary tree contains only one node, it is a uni-value tree.

For any node that is not `null` in a binary tree, how to determine whether the subtree with the node as the root is a uni-value subtree? Consider the following 3 cases.

1. If the subtree contains only one node, which means the root of the subtree has no child, then the subtree is a uni-value subtree.

2. If the root of the subtree has only one child, then the subtree is a uni-value subtree if and only if the subtree with root at the child is a uni-value subtree and the current subtree's root's value equals its child's value.

3. If the root of the subtree has two children, then the subtree is a uni-value subtree if and only if the subtrees with roots at both children are uni-value subtrees and the current subtree's root's value equals both its children's values.
