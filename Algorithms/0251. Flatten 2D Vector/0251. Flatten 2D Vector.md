# 251. Flatten 2D Vector
## Level
Medium

## Description
Design and implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector. It should support the following operations: `next` and `hasNext`. 

**Example:**
```
Vector2D iterator = new Vector2D([[1,2],[3],[4]]);

iterator.next(); // return 1
iterator.next(); // return 2
iterator.next(); // return 3
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next(); // return 4
```

**Notes:**

1. Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Vector2D, as static/class variables are **persisted across multiple test cases**. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
2. You may assume that `next()` call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next element in the 2d vector when `next()` is called.

As an added challenge, try to code it using only [iterators in C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/iterator/) or [iterators in Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html).

## Solution
Use a list to store all the elements. In the constructor, loop over `v` and add all the elements to the list in the original order of `v`, obtain the number of elements as `size`, and set `index` to 0.

When `next()` is called, obtain the value at `index` as the return value, increase `index` by 1, and return the return value.

When `hasNext()` is called, return `true` if and only if `index` is less than `size`.
