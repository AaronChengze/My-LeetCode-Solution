## Description
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...]` (s<sub>i</sub> < e<sub>i</sub>), determine if a person could attend all meetings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]

**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[7,10],[2,4]]

**Output:** true

## Solution
First sort `intervals` by the start times and the end times. Then check all adjacent intervals. If there exist two adjacent intervals such that the first interval's end time is greater than the second interval's start time, then it is impossible to attend both meetings, so return `false`. If there is no conflict between any intervals, return `true`.
