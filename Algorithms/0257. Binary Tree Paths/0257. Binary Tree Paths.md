# 257. Binary Tree Paths
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**
```
Input:

   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5

Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

Explanation: All root-to-leaf paths are: 1->2->5, 1->3
```

## Solution
Use breadth first search. When each node is visited, store the corresponding path from the root to the current node. If a leaf is met, add the root-to-leaf path to the result list.
