## Description
Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example:**

**Input:**  [1,2,1,3,2,5]

**Output:** [3,5]

**Note:**

1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

## Solution
Since a number doing bitwise XOR operation with itself will result in 0, and the order of numbers does not affect the result of bitwise XOR operation, do bitwise XOR operation on all the numbers in the array `nums`. The result is the bitwise XOR operation of the two numbers that appear only once. Suppose the two elements that appear only once are `a` and `b`, and let the bitwise XOR operation result be `result`.

Then let `n = result ^ (~(result - 1))`, and `n` contains the least significant bit in `result` that is 1. The bit 1 in `n` means that `a` and `b` differ at the bit.

We have `a ^ b == result`. The following properties also hold. We have `a ^ result == b` and `b ^ result == a`. Use `n` as a flag to split `a` and `b`.
