# 261. Graph Valid Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1` and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]

**Output:** false

**Note:** you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0,1]` is the same as `[1,0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

## Solution
If there are `n` nodes, to form a tree, there must be `n - 1` edges. If the number of edges is not `n - 1`, return false.

Since a tree is a connected graph, check whether all the nodes belong to the same connected component. Initially, each node belongs to its own connected component. Each time an edge is introduced, update each node's component and the nodes in each component. Finally, return `true` if and only if there is one connected component.
