# 263. Ugly Number
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 6

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** 6 = 2 × 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 8

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** 8 = 2 × 2 × 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 14

**Output:** false 

**Explanation:** 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

**Note:**

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1].

## Solution
For the given number, divide it by each prime number among 2, 3, 5 respectively until the number is not divisible by the current prime number. After division, the prime factors 2, 3, 5 from the given number are removed. If the number becomes 1, it doesn't contain other prime factors, so return `true`. Otherwise, the number contains other prime factors, so return `false`.
