# 264. Ugly Number II

## Description
Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. 

**Example:**

**Input:** n = 10

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

**Note:**

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. `n` **does not exceed 1690**.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming to find the first `n` ugly numbers. Create an array `dp` with length `n`. The first ugly number is 1, so `dp[0] = 1`. Use three pointers `pointer2`, `pointer3` and `pointer5` to represent each factor 2, 3 and 5, which initially point to the first ugly number.

Each time calculate the minimum number among `dp[pointer2] * 2`, `dp[pointer3] * 3` and `dp[pointer5] * 5`, and the minimum number among the three numbers is the next ugly number. The obtained number is an ugly number since its prime factors only include 2, 3 and 5. Since the obtained number is the minimum possible ugly number greater than the ugly numbers that are already stored, it is the next ugly number. As the next ugly number is obtained, move the corresponding pointer(s) one step forward.

Finally, return the `n`-th ugly number.
