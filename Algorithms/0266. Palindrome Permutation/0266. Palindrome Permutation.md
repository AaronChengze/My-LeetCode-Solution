# 266. Palindrome Permutation
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "code"

**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "aab"

**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "carerac"

**Output:** true

## Solution
If a string has a permutation that is a palindrome, then there is at most one character in the string that occurs odd number of times. Loop over the string and count each character's number of  occurrence. If there are two characters that occur odd numbers of times, then it is impossible to have a palindrome permutation of the string, so return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.
