# 274. H-Index
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index h if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N* - *h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

**Example:**

**Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with **at least 3** citations each and the remaining two with **no more than** 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

**Note:** If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

## Solution
First sort the array `citations`. Next use binary search. Set `low` to be 0 and `high` to be `citations.length - 1` initially. Each time set `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high` and get the number of citations at index `mid`. If `citations[mid] < citations.length - mid`, then obviously `mid` is to the left of the correct position, so set `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, set `high = mid`. Finally, return `citations.length - low`, which represents the h-index.
