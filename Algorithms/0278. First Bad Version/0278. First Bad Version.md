# 278. First Bad Version
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:
```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

## Solution
Use binary search. Suppose there are `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]`, initially `low = 1` and `high = n`. The loop condition is `low < high`. Each time set `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high`. If version `mid` is not a bad version, then the first bad version is after `mid`, so set `low` to `mid + 1`. If version `mid` is a bad version, then the first bad version may be `mid` or somewhere before `mid`, so set `high` to `mid`. The loop breaks when `low` equals `high`, and both variables point to the first bad version.
