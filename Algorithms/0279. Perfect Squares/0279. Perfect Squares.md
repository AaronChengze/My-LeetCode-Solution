# 279. Perfect Squares
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a positive integer *n*, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, `1, 4, 9, 16, ...`) which sum to *n*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** *n* = 12

**Output:** 3

Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** *n* = 13

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** 13 = 4 + 9.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create an array `dp` with length `n + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the least number of perfect square numbers which sum to `i`.

Initialize `dp[i] = i` for `i` from 1 to `n`, since any number `i` can be represented by the sum of several 1's, and 1 is a perfect square number. Then for any `i` that is a perfect square number, set `dp[i] = 1`. For the other numbers, to find `dp[i]`, for each `j` such that `j * j <= i`, set `dp[i]` as the minimum possible value of `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.
