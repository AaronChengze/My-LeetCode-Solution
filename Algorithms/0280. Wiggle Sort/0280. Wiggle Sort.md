# 280. Wiggle Sort
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an unsorted array `nums`, reorder it **in-place** such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`.

**Example:**

**Input:** nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]

**Output:** One possible answer is [3,5,1,6,2,4]

## Solution
This problem can be solved in several ways. This solution is based on sorting.

First, sort the array `nums` in ascending order. Next, for any even index `i`, swap the numbers at indices `i` and `i + 1` in the array `nums`.

The reason why this solution works is as follows. After sorting the array, we have `nums[0] <= nums[1] <= nums[2] <= nums[3] <= nums[4] <= ...`. After swapping, the sequence becomes `nums[0], nums[2], nums[1], nums[4], nums[3], ...`, where the indices are from the sorted array. Obviously, `nums[0] <= nums[2] >= nums[1] <= nums[4] >= nums[3]...`.
