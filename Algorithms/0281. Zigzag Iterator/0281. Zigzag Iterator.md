# 281. Zigzag Iterator
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

**Example:**
```
Input:
v1 = [1,2]
v2 = [3,4,5,6] 
Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
```

**Follow up:**

What if you are given `k` 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

**Clarification for the follow up question:**

The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for `k > 2` cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For example:
```
Input:
[1,2,3]
[4,5,6,7]
[8,9]

Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
```

## Solution
In the constructor, use one single list to store the elements from both 1d vectors in the altenate order.

Let `size1` and `size2` be the sizes of the two 1d vectors respectively, and let `minSize` be the minimum of `size1` and `size2`. For indices from 0 to `minSize - 1`, obtain the element from the first 1d vector at the index and add it to the list, and obtain the element from the second 1d vector at the index and add it to the list. If there are remaining elements in one of the vectors, add the remaining elements in the vector to the list.

After the elements are stored in the single list, the methods `next` and `hasNext` are quite straightforward. Simply initialize `index` to 0, and get the element at position `index` in the list. If `index` is less than the total number of elements, then `hasNext` method returns `true`.
