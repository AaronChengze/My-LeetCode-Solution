# 282. Expression Add Operators
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string that contains only digits `0-9` and a target value, return all possibilities to add **binary** operators (not unary) `+`, `-`, or `*` between the digits so they evaluate to the target value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "123", target = 6

**Output:** ["1+2+3", "1*2*3"] 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = "232", target = 8

**Output:** ["2*3+2", "2+3*2"]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = "105", target = 5

**Output:** ["1*0+5","10-5"]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** num = "00", target = 0

**Output:** ["0+0", "0-0", "0*0"]

**Example 5:**

**Input:** num = "3456237490", target = 9191

**Output:** []

## Solution
Use backtrack. For each index `i` from 1 to `num.length() - 1`, there are four choices, which are to insert an operator `+`, `-` or `*` at index `i`, or not to insert any operator at index `i`. For the last choice, it is only available when the last number before index `i` has length 1 or does not have leading zeros. To check this, maintain a previous index `prevIndex`, which is initially 0, and the last number is the substring `num.substring(prevIndex, index)`. After a choice is made at index `i`, move to the next index and find the expressions recursively.

At each index, if an operator is inserted, then maintain the current expression as well, including the numbers and the operators. If the end of `num` is met, then calculate the result of the expression. If the expression equals `target`, then add the expression to the result list.

Finally, return the result list.
