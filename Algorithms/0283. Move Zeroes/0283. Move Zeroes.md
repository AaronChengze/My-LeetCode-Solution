# 283. Move Zeroes
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

**Input:** [0,1,0,3,12]

**Output:** [1,3,12,0,0]

Note:

1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

## Solution
Use a variable `index` to store the number of non-zero elements. Loop over the array `nums`. If an element is non-zero, then assign it to the element at position `index`, and increase `index` by 1. After the array is looped over, set the elements at the remaining positions to 0.
