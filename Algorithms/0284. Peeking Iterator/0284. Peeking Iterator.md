# 284. Peeking Iterator
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an Iterator class interface with methods: `next()` and `hasNext()`, design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the `peek()` operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

**Example:**

Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: **[1,2,3]**.

Call **next()** gets you **1**, the first element in the list.

Now you call **peek()** and it returns **2**, the next element. Calling **next()** after that still return **2**.

You call **next()** the final time and it returns **3**, the last element.

Calling **hasNext()** after that should return **false**.

**Follow up:** How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?

## Solution
Use a list to store all the elements in the iterator. The elements are added to the list in the constructor. In the constructor, also initialize `size` to be the number of elements and `index` to be 0.

When `peek()` is called, return the element at position `index` in the list.

When `next()` is called, get the element at position `index`, increase `index` by 1, and return the element.

When `hasNext()` is called, check whether `index` is less than `size`. If so, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
