# 298. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).

**Example 1:**
```
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    / \
   2   4
        \
         5

Output: 3

Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:

   2
    \
     3
    / 
   2    
  / 
 1

Output: 2 

Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.
```

## Solution
If the tree is empty, return 0.

Use breadth first search. Use two queues to store the nodes and the corresponding lengths of the longest consecutive sequences. Initially, the root and 1 are offered to the queues. Each time a node and its length are polled from the queues, update the maximum length, check the node's two children. For each child, if the child's value is greater than its parent's value by 1, then set the child's length to its parent's length plus 1. Otherwise, set the child's length to 1. Offer the child and its length to the queues.

Finally, return the maximum length.
