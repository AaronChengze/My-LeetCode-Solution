# 302. Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels
## Level
Hard

## Description
An image is represented by a binary matrix with `0` as a white pixel and `1` as a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location `(x, y)` of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.

**Example:**
```
Input:
[
  "0010",
  "0110",
  "0100"
]
and x = 0, y = 2

Output: 6
```

## Solution
One straightforward solution is to do breadth first search. Starting from `image[x][y]`, search all the black pixels and find the top, the bottom, the left and the right of the black pixels area, and the smallest rectangle's area can be calculated.

Another solution that uses binary search has a less time complexity and a less space complexity, which is kind of difficult to think of.
