# 307. Range Sum Query - Mutable
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer array *nums*, find the sum of the elements between indices *i* and *j* (*i* â‰¤ *j*), inclusive.

The *update(i, val)* function modifies *nums* by updating the element at index *i* to val.

**Example:**
```
Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
update(1, 2)
sumRange(0, 2) -> 8
```

**Note:**

1. The array is only modifiable by the *update* function.
2. You may assume the number of calls to *update* and *sumRange* function is distributed evenly.

## Solution
Use segment tree. Let `length` be `nums.length`. Create an array `segmentTree` with length `length * 2`.

In the constructor, set `segmentTree[i + length] = nums[i]` for `0 <= i < length`, and set `segmentTree[i] = segmentTree[i * 2] + segmentTree[i * 2 + 1]` for `i` from `length - 1` to 1.

For method `update`, calculate the difference `val - segmentTree[i + length]`. For `index` which is initially `i + length`, increase `segmentTree[index]` by the difference and set `index = index / 2`. Repeat the process until `index` becomes 0.

For method `sumRange`, calculate indices `left = i + length` and `right = j + length`. While `left <= right`, repeat the process as follows. If `left` is odd, add `segmentTree[left]` to the sum and increase `left` by 1. If `right` is even, add `segmentTree[right]` to the sum and decrease `right` by 1. Then set `left = left / 2` and `right = right / 2`. Finally, return the sum.
