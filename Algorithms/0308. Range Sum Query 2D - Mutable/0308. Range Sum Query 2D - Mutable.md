## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a 2D matrix *matrix*, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (*row*1, *col*1) and lower right corner (*row*2, *col*2).

The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = **(2, 1)** and (row2, col2) = **(4, 3)**, which contains sum = **8**.

**Example:**
```
Given matrix = [
  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]

sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
update(3, 2, 2)
sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 10
```

**Note:**
1. The matrix is only modifiable by the *update* function.
2. You may assume the number of calls to *update* and *sumRegion* function is distributed evenly.
3. You may assume that *row*1 ≤ *row*2 and *col*1 ≤ *col*2.

## Solution
In the class `NumMatrix`, maintain the original matrix `matrix` and maintain another 2D array `rowSums` that has the same size as `matrix` and stores the sums of the elements to the left in the same row. Concretely, `rowSums[i][j]` is the sum of all elements from `matrix[i][0]` to `matrix[i][j]`. Also maintain `rows` and `columns` of `matrix` as well.

For the constructor, initialize the original matrix `matrix`, the 2D array `rowSums`, and `rows` and `columns`.

For `update`, calculate `difference = val - matrix[row][column]`, update `matrix[row][col] = val`, and for `col <= i < columns`, update `rowSums[row][i] += difference`.

For `sumRegion`, if `row1 > row2` or `col1 > col2`, then the region is invalid, so return 0. Otherwise, for each row from `row1` to `row2`, calculate the sum of elements from column `col1` to column `col2`. The sum in row `row` and columns range `[col1, col2]` is calculated as `rowSums[row][col2]` for `col1 == 0`, or `rowSums[row][col2] - rowSums[row][col1 - 1]` for `col1 > 0`.
