# 313. Super Ugly Number
## Level
Medium

## Description
Write a program to find the `n`<sup>th</sup> super ugly number.

Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list `primes` of size `k`.

**Example:**

**Input:** n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]

**Output:** 32 

**Explanation:** [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19] of size 4.

**Note:**

* `1` is a super ugly number for any given `primes`.
* The given numbers in `primes` are in ascending order.
* 0 < `k` ≤ 100, 0 < `n` ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>, 0 < `primes[i]` < 1000.
* The n<sup>th</sup> super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming to find the first `n` super ugly numbers. Create an array `dp` with length `n`. The first super ugly number is 1, so `dp[0] = 1`. Create an array `pointers` of size `k`, which is the size of `primes`. Each `pointer` in `pointers` represents the corresponding factor in `primes`, which initially points to the first super ugly number.

Each time calculate the minimum number among all possible `dp[j] * j` where `0 <= j < k`, and the minimum number is the next super ugly number. The obtained number is a super ugly number since its prime factors only include the prime numbers in `primes`. Since the obtained number is the minimum possible super ugly number greater than the super ugly numbers that are already stored, it is the next super ugly number. As the next super ugly number is obtained, move the corresponding pointer(s) one step forward.

Finally, return the `n`<sup>th</sup> super ugly number.
