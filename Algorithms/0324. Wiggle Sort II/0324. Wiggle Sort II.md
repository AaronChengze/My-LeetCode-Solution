## Description
Given an unsorted array `nums`, reorder it such that `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4]

**Output:** One possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]

**Output:** One possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].

**Note:**

You may assume all input has valid answer.

Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?

## Solution
First sort the array `nums`. Then split the sorted array `nums` into two parts, the left part or the right part. The number of elements in the left part is equal to the number of elements in the right part if `nums` contains even number of elements, otherwise the number of elements in the left part is greater than the number of elements in the right part by 1.

Use an array `temp` to store the reordered elements. For the elements in the left part of `nums`, put them at even indices in `temp`, from right to left. For the elements in the right part of `nums`, put them at odd indices in `temp`, from right to left. Finally, copy the elements from `temp` to `nums`.
