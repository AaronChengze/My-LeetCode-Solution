# 327. Count of Range Sum
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper] inclusive`.

Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (`i` â‰¤ `j`), inclusive.

**Note:**

A naive algorithm of O(*n*<sup>2</sup>) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

**Example:**

**Input:** nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,

**Output:** 3 

**Explanation:** The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

## Solution
Calculate prefix sums of array `nums`, which is `sums`, such that at index `i`, the prefix sum `sums[i]` is the sum of all elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[i]`, inclusive. The number of range sums equals the number of index pairs `(i, j)` such that `lower <= sums[j] - sums[i] <= upper` where `i <= j`, which is equivalent to `sums[j] - upper <= sums[i] <= sums[j] - lower`.

Use a tree map to store each prefix sum and the number of occurrences of the prefix sum. For each number in `nums`, update the prefix sum, which is `prefixSum`, and obtain the submap from the tree map such that the keys are in the range `[prefixSum - upper, perfixSum - lower]` (both inclusive), and for each entry in the submap, add the entry's value to the total count. Finally, return the total count.
