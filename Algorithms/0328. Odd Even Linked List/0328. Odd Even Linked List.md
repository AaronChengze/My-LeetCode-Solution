# 328. Odd Even Linked List
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1->2->3->4->5->NULL

**Output:** 1->3->5->2->4->NULL

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL

**Output:** 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL

**Note:**

* The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
* The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

## Solution
First, store the odd head and the even head. Next, use two pointers that point to odd nodes and even nodes respectively. Initially, the odd pointer points to the first node (which is the head) and the even pointer points to the second node (which is the next node of the head). If neither pointer has reached the end, simply update the nodes that each pointer's next points to, and move each pointer to the next odd node and the next even node. If the even pointer has reached the last node, then the odd pointer has also reached the last odd node, so set the odd pointer's node's next to point to the even head. If the even pointer has reached the second last node, then the last node in the list is the last odd node, so update the nodes that each node's next points to.
