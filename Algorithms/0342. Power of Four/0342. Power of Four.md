# 342. Power of Four
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 16

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 5

**Output:** false

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Solution
If `n` is not a positive integer, it can't be a power of four, so return `false`. Divide `n` by 4 until `n` can't be divisible by 4. If `n` is a power of four, then it will eventually become 1. If `n` is not 1 after dividing `n` by 4 repeatedly, then `n` is not a power of four.
