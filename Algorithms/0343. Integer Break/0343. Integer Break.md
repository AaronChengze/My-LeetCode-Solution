# 343. Integer Break
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a positive integer *n*, break it into the sum of **at least** two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 2

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 10

**Output:** 36

**Explanation:** 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.

**Note:** You may assume that *n* is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

## Solution
If *n* is 2, return 1. If *n* is 3, return 2.

To get the maximum product, break *n* into the sum of as many as 3's as possible until the remaining number is 4 or 2, and then as many as 2's possible. For example, 8 = 3 + 3 + 2, 10 = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2.

For a number greater than 3, it can always be broken into two numbers that has an equal or a greater product. For example, 4 = 2 + 2 and 2 × 2 = 4, 5 = 2 + 3 and 2 × 3 = 6 > 5, 6 = 3 + 3 and 3 × 3 = 9 > 6.

Since 3 × 3 = 9 > 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, breaking *n* into the sum of 3's first is optimal.

After *n* is broken into the sum of several numbers in the way mentioned above, return the product of these numbers.
