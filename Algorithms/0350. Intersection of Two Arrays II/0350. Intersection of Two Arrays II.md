# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]

**Output:** [2,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]

**Output:** [4,9]

**Note:**

* Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
* The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**

* What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if *nums1*'s size is small compared to *nums2*'s size? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of *nums2* are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## Solution
First, sort the two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. Then use two pointers `index1` and `index2` for `nums1` and `nums2` respectively, which initially point to index 0 of each array. Each time check the numbers `num1 = nums1[index1]` and `num2 = nums2[index2]`. If `num1 == num2`, then the number (either `num1 or num2` is in the intersection, so add the number to the intersection list. Otherwise, move the pointer that points the smaller number one step forward. If either pointer reaches the end of the array, then no more numbers will be in the intersection. Finally, use an array to store all the numbers in the intersection list, and return the array.
