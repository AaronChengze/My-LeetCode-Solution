# 354. Russian Doll Envelopes
## Level
Hard

## Description
You have a number of envelopes with widths and heights given as a pair of integers `(w, h)`. One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of the other envelope.

What is the maximum number of envelopes can you Russian doll? (put one inside other)

**Note:**

Rotation is not allowed.

**Example:**

**Input:** [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]

**Output:** 3 

**Explanation:** The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. First, sort `envelopes` according to widths in ascending order and then according to heights in ascending order. Then create an array `dp` of length `envelopes.length` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of envelopes to Russian doll when the last envelope is the `i`-th envelope. Initialize all elements in `dp` to 1, since selecting any envelope will have at least one envelope to Russian doll.

For each index `i` from 1 to `envelopes.length - 1`, loop over each index `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. If `envelopes[j]` is smaller than `envelopes[i]` in both width and height, then update `dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. Finally, loop over `dp` to obtain the greatest value and return.
