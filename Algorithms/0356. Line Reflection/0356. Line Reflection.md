# 356. Line Reflection
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to y-axis that reflect the given points.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,1],[-1,1]]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[1,1],[-1,-1]]

**Output:** false

## Solution
Loop over `points` to find the leftmost x-axis value and the rightmost y-axis value. If there exists a line that reflects the given points, the line must be in the middle of the leftmost point and the rightmost point.

Use two sets to store the original points and the original points with the reflection points, respectively. For each `point` in `points`, add it to the first set, obtain the reflection point, and add both the original point and the reflection point to the second set. Return `true` if and only if the two sets have the same size.
