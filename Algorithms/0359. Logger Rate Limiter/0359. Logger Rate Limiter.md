# 359. Logger Rate Limiter
## Level
Easy

## Description
Design a logger system that receive stream of messages along with its timestamps, each message should be printed if and only if it is **not printed in the last 10 seconds**.

Given a message and a timestamp (in seconds granularity), return true if the message should be printed in the given timestamp, otherwise returns false.

It is possible that several messages arrive roughly at the same time.

**Example:**
```
Logger logger = new Logger();

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 1
logger.shouldPrintMessage(1, "foo"); returns true; 

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 2
logger.shouldPrintMessage(2,"bar"); returns true;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 3
logger.shouldPrintMessage(3,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "bar" at timestamp 8
logger.shouldPrintMessage(8,"bar"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 10
logger.shouldPrintMessage(10,"foo"); returns false;

// logging string "foo" at timestamp 11
logger.shouldPrintMessage(11,"foo"); returns true;
```

## Solution
Use a map to store each message's last timestamp that was printed. Each time a message and a timestamp is given, check whether the message has been printed and the last timestamp it was printed if it has been printed. If the message has not been printed or the last time it was printed was at least 10 seconds prior to the current timestamp, then update the map for the message with the current timestamp and return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
