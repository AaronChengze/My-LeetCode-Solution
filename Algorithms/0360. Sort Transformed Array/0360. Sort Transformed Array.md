# 360. Sort Transformed Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **sorted** array of integers nums and integer values *a*, *b* and *c*. Apply a quadratic function of the form f(*x*) = *ax*<sup>2</sup> + *bx* + *c* to each element *x* in the array.

The returned array must be in **sorted order**.

Expected time complexity: **O(*n*)**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-4,-2,2,4], a = 1, b = 3, c = 5

**Output:** [3,9,15,33]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-4,-2,2,4], a = -1, b = 3, c = 5

**Output:** [-23,-5,1,7]

## Solution
First check whether *a* is 0. If *a* is 0, then the function is a linear function, so check whether *b* is negative. If *b* is negative, get the values of the function in the reverse order of the array, otherwise get the values of the function in the same order of the array.

If *a* is not 0, then the function is a quadratic function. Find the symmetry axis which is -*b*/(2*a*). which is the bottom point of the quadratic function if *a* > 0 or the top point of the quadratic function if *a* < 0. If there is an *x* in the array that equals -*b*/(2*a*), then get the value of the function using *x*=-*b*/(2*a*) and put the value in the first position of the result array if *a* > 0 or in the last position of the result array if *a* < 0.

Use two pointers to point to different indices in the array. Each time take the number from the array that is closer to the symmetry axis, calculate the function value of the number, and move the corresponding index one step away from the symmetry axis, until all the numbers in the array are used. The function values are stored into the result array from left to right if *a* > 0 or from right to left if *a* < 0.

Finally, return the result list, which is guaranteed to be sorted.
