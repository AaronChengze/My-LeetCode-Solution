# 364. Nested List Weight Sum II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Different from the [previous question](https://leetcode.com/problems/nested-list-weight-sum/) where weight is increasing from root to leaf, now the weight is defined from bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the largest weight.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,1],2,[1,1]]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** Four 1's at depth 1, one 2 at depth 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,[4,[6]]]

**Output:** 17

**Explanation:** One 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1; 1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17.

## Solution
Use the idea of breadth first search. Initially store each element's depth as top-down since we do not know the maximum depth in advance. For each element, store its depth as well. If an element is an integer, then store its value and its depth. If an element is a list, then for each element in the list, offer them to the queue and store each elements' depth as the current depth plus 1.

After all the elements are visited, the maximum depth is also obtained, and the sum can be calculated. For each number, its weight is the maximum depth minus its depth plus 1. Multiply the number by its weight and add the multiplied number to the sum.
