# 368. Largest Divisible Subset
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a set of **distinct** positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (S<sub>i</sub>, S<sub>j</sub>) of elements in this subset satisfies:

S<sub>i</sub> % S<sub>j</sub> = 0 or S<sub>j</sub> % S<sub>i</sub> = 0.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3]

**Output:** [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,4,8]

**Output:** [1,2,4,8]

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Since this problem requires returning the largest subset, not the size of the largest subset, for each number, its previous number should also be stored.

Sort the array `nums`. Let `length` be `nums.length`. Create a 2D array `dp` of `length` rows and 2 columns, where `dp[i][0]` represents the largest subset size that ends at index `i`, and `dp[i][1]` represents the previous index of the largest subset that ends at index `i`. Initially, for all `0 <= i < length`, `dp[i][0] = 1` and `dp[i][1] = -1`.

Loop over `nums` starting from index 1. For all `0 < i < length`, find the index `j` such that `0 <= j < i` and `dp[j][0]` is the largest, and update `dp[i][0] = dp[j][0] + 1` and `dp[i][1] = j`.

Then find the index `maxEndIndex` such that `dp[maxEndIndex][0]` is the greatest value in the first row of `dp`. Starting from `maxEndIndex`, find all the indices in the largest divisible subset, and obtain the numbers from `nums`. Add the numbers in the largest divisible subset to the result list and return.
