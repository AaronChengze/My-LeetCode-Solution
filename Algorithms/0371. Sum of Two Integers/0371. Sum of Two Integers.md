# 371. Sum of Two Integers
## Level
Easy

## Description
Calculate the sum of two integers *a* and *b*, but you are **not allowed** to use the operator `+` and `-`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = 1, b = 2

**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = -2, b = 3

**Output:** 1

## Solution
Use bitwise operations. The operation `a + b` is equivalent to `(a ^ b) + ((a & b) << 1)`. Set `a` to `(a & b) << 1` and set `b` to `a ^ b` until `a` becomes 0, and return `b`.
