## Description
Your task is to calculate *a*<sup>*b*</sup> mod 1337 where *a* is a positive integer and *b* is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = 2, b = [3]

**Output:** 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = 2, b = [1,0]

**Output:** 1024

## Solution
Each time calculate the power using one digit in *b* starting from the most significant digit. Use the property that (*a*^*b*)^*c* = *a*^(*bc*). Here *c* = 10. Therefore, after one digit in *b* is used for calculation, the next digit of *b* can also be used for calculation.
