# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
## Level
Easy

## Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to ***n***. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):
```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

**Example:**

**Input:** n = 10, pick = 6

**Output:** 6

## Solution
Use binary search. Initially, set `low` to 1 and `high` to `n`. Each time, set the guess number to be the average of `low` and `high`, and guess the number. If the result is 0, then the number is the correct one, so return the number. If the result is -1, then the guess number is higher than the correct number, so set `high` to be the guess number minus 1. If the result is 1, then the guess number is lower than the correct number, so set `low` to be the guess number plus 1.
