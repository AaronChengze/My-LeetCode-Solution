## Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay **$x**. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

**Example:**
```
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
```

Given a particular **n ≥ 1**, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a **win**.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `n + 1` rows and `n + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum money needed to guarantee a win when guessing in the range `[i, j]`.

Initially, `dp[i][i] = 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`. To obtain `dp[i][j]` where `i < j`, select any number between `i` and `j` inclusive, and finally determine the number to be selected for guessing that leads to the minimum possible value of `dp[i][j]`.

Finally, return `dp[1][n]`.
