# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a *n* x *n* matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

**Example:**
```
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
],
k = 8,

return 13.
```
Note:
Use binary search. Initially let `low` be the smallest element in the matrix, which is the top-left element, and let `high` be the greatest element in the matrix, which is the bottom-right element.

Each time set `target` to be the average of `low` and `high`, and find the number of elements that is less than or equal to `target`. If such number of elements is less than `k`, then set `low = target + 1`. Otherwise, set `high = target`. The search ends when `low` and `high` become the same value. In this case, return `low`.
