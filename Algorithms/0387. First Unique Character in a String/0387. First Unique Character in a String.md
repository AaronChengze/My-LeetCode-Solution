# 387. First Unique Character in a String
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

**Examples:**
```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```

**Note:** You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

## Solution
Use two maps to store each index with its corresponding character, and store each character and its corresponding indices. Loop over the string once and update the two maps. Then loop over the string for the second time. For each index, obtain the character and obtain the indices list of the character. If the indices list contains only one element, then the character is unique, so return the character. This is guaranteed to be the first unique character since the indices are visited from 0 to the string's length. If no unique character is found, return -1.
