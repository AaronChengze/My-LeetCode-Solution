# 392. Is Subsequence
## Level

## Description
Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both **s** and **t**. **t** is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and **s** is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while "aec" is not).

**Example 1:**

**s** = `"abc"`, **t** = `"ahbgdc"`

Return `true`.

**Example 2:**

**s** = `"axc"`, **t** = `"ahbgdc"`

Return `false`.

**Follow up:**

If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution
Loop over `t`. Use a pointer that points to the index in `s`. If the current character in `t` equals the character in `s` that the pointer points to, then move the pointer in `s` one step ahead. If at one point, the pointer reaches the end of `s` (concretely, the pointer points to index `s.length()`, which is one step after the last character in `s`), then the characters in `s` are in the same order as the corresponding characters in `t` and therefore `s` is subsequence of `t`. If the pointer never reaches the end of `s`, then `s` is not subsequence of `t`.
