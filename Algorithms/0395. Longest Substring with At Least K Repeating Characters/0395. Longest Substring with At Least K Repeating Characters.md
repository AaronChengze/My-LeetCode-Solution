# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters
## Level
Medium

## Description
Find the length of the longest substring ***T*** of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in ***T*** appears no less than *k* times.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5
```

## Solution
If `s` is empty, then obviously there is no such substring that has a length greater than 0, so return 0.

Loop over `s` and count the number of occurrences of each letter. Use a set to store the characters that appears at least once but less than *k* times. After the loop, if the set is empty, then all the characters in `s` appear at least *k* times, so `s` itself is the longest substring, and the length is `s.length()`.

Use recursion. Two base cases are mentioned above. Initialize `startIndex` to 0. For each index `i` from 0 to `s.length() - 1`, check the character at index `i`. If the character is in the set, then call the method on the substring `s.substring(startIndex, i)` and update the maximum length. Then update `startIndex = i + 1` and move forward. After `i` reaches the end, call the method on the substring `s.substring(startIndex, i)` to update the maximum length. Finally, return the maximum length.
