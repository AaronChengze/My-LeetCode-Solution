# 396. Rotate Function

## Description
Given an array of integers `A` and let *n* to be its length.

Assume `B_k` to be an array obtained by rotating the array `A` *k* positions clock-wise, we define a "rotation function" `F` on `A` as follow:

`F(k) = 0 * B_k[0] + 1 * B_k[1] + ... + (n-1) * B_k[n-1]`.

Calculate the maximum value of `F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1)`.

**Note:**

*n* is guaranteed to be less than 10<sup>5</sup>.

**Example:**
```
A = [4, 3, 2, 6]

F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26

So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.
```

## Solution
If the length of `A` is less than or equal to 1, then the rotation function can only have value 0, so return 0.

Calculate the sum of elements in `A`, which is `sum`, and calculate `F(0)`. To obtain `F(k)` from `F(k-1)` where `k > 0`, the relation between `F(k)` and `F(k-1)` is `F(k) = F(k-1) + sum - n * A[n - k]`. The reason is that after rotating the array `B_k` by 1 position, all coefficients of elements in `B_k` are increased by 1, except the last element in `B_k`, which should be decreased by `n` after it is increased by 1.

Update the maximum function value after each calculation. Finally, return the maximum function value.
