# 410. Split Array Largest Sum
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer *m*, you can split the array into *m* non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these *m* subarrays.

**Note:**

If *n* is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

* 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 1000
* 1 ≤ *m* ≤ min(50, *n*)

**Examples:**
```
Input:
nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
m = 2

Output:
18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `n + 1` rows and `m + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum possible value of the largest sum among the `j` subarrays of `nums[0 .. i-1]`. Therefore, `dp[i][j]` can be calculated as `Math.max(dp[k][j - 1], nums[k] + nums[k + 1] + ... + nums[i - 1])`, where `0 <= k < i`. The final result is `dp[n][m]`.
