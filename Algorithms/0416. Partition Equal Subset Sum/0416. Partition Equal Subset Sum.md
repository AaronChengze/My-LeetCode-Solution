# 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **non-empty** array containing **only positive integers**, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

**Note:**

1. Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
2. The array size will not exceed 200.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

## Solution
First calculate the sum of the numbers in the array `nums`. If the sum is odd, then it is impossible to partition the array into two subsets that have equal sum, so return `false`.

Let `length` be the length of the array `nums` and let `target` be half of the sum of the numbers in the array `nums`. Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of type `boolean` with `length` rows and `target + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents whether it is possible to select some numbers from the first `i` numbers of `nums` such that they sum up to `j`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `target`. Initialize column 0 for each row to be `true` since selecting nothing will lead to sum 0. Then initialize `dp[0][nums[0]] = true`. For `i` from 1 to `length - 1`, let `num = nums[i]`, and for each `j` from 1 to `target`, update `dp[i][j]` as `dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i - 1][j - num]`, where the latter can only be applied when `j >= num`. If the first `i - 1` numbers contain one or more numbers that sum up to `j`, then when the `i`-th number is added, the same numbers still sum up to `j`. If `j >= num` and the first `i - 1` numbers contain one or more numbers that sum up to `j - num`, then when the `i`-th number which is `num` is added, the same numbers still sum up to `j - num`, and the same numbers with the newly added number `num` will sum up to `j`.

Finally, return `dp[length - 1][target]`.
