# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

**Note:**

Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

s = "ABAB", k = 2

**Output:**

4

**Explanation:**

Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

s = "AABABBA", k = 1

**Output:**

4

**Explanation:**

Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".

The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

## Solution
Use sliding window. Use a map to store each letter and the number of occurrences of each letter. Initialize `low` and `high` to 0, and use `maxCount` to store the maximum numbers of the same letter met so far, which is initially 0.

Loop over `s` using index `high`. Obtain the letter at index `high`, update the number of occurrences of the letter in the map, and update `maxCount`. If the current substring's length `high - low + 1` is greater than `maxCount + k`, then move `low` forward by 1 step. Move `high` forward by 1 step after the letter is dealt with. Finally, return `s.length() - low`.
