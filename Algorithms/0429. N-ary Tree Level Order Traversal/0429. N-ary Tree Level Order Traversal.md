# 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an n-ary tree, return the *level order* traversal of its nodes' values.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

**Output:** [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

**Output:** [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]

**Constraints:**

* The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
* The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`

## Solution
Use breadth first search. The top level contains only the root. For each level, use a list to store the values of the nodes in the level from left to right. For each node in the level, obtain the children and offer them to the queue for the next level's search. After a level is visited, add the level's list to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
