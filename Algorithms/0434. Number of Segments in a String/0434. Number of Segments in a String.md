# 434. Number of Segments in a String
## Level
Easy

## Description
Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Please note that the string does not contain any **non-printable** characters.

**Example:**

**Input:** "Hello, my name is John"

**Output:** 5

## Solution
If there are continuous spaces in the string, replace them with a single space. Then split the string using space to form an array, and return the length of the array.
