# 440. K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given integers `n` and `k`, find the lexicographically k-th smallest integer in the range from `1` to `n`.

Note: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>.

**Example:**

**Input:**

n: 13   k: 2

**Output:**

10

**Explanation:**

The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.

## Solution
Starting from 1, let `curr` be the current prefix, and the next prefix is `curr + 1`. Count the number of integers with prefix `curr`. If the number of integers with prefix `curr` is greater than `k`, then set `curr = curr * 10` and use the updated `curr` to calculate the next prefix `curr + 1`. Otherwise, subtract the number of integers from `k`, and set `curr = curr + 1`. Repeat the process until `k` becomes 0. Finally, return `curr`.
