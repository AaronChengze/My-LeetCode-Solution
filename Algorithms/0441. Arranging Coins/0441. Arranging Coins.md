# 441. Arranging Coins
## Level
Easy

## Description
You have a total of *n* coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every *k*-th row must have exactly *k* coins.

Given *n*, find the total number of **full** staircase rows that can be formed.

*n* is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```
**Example 2:**
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

## Solution
Initially set `row` to 0. While `n` is greater than `row`, each time increase `row` by 1 and subtract `row` from `n`. When the loop ends, return `row`, which represents the total numbero full staircase rows that can be formed.
