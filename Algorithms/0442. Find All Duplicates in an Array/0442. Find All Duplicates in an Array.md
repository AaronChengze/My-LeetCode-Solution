# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ *n* (*n* = size of array), some elements appear **twice** and others appear **once**.

Find all the elements that appear **twice** in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(*n*) runtime?

**Example:**

**Input:** [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

**Output:** [2,3]

## Solution
Since the array has length *n* and all elements in the array are in the range [1, *n*], the elements in the array can be used as indices. For example, if an element is *k*, then it represents the index *k* - 1.

Loop over the array once. For each `num` in `nums`, the corresponding index is `num - 1`, so set `nums[num - 1]` to its opposite number, which means the index `num - 1` is visited. If `nums[num - 1]` is already negative, then `num - 1` has already been visited, so the number `num` is duplicated number and add `num` to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
