# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ *n* (*n* = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, *n*] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(*n*) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

**Input:**
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

**Output:**
[5,6]

## Solution
First rearrange the array so that each number is at the correct position. That is, each number `k` should be at `nums[k - 1]`.

Next loop over the array to find the numbers that do not appear in the array. If a number at index `i` is not `i + 1`, then `i + 1` is missing. Add all the missing numbers to the result list.
