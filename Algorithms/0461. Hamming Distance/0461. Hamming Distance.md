# 461. Hamming Distance
## Level
Easy

## Description
The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x `and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**

0 â‰¤ `x`, `y` < 2<sup>31</sup>.

**Example:**

**Input:** x = 1, y = 4

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

1   (0 0 0 1)

4   (0 1 0 0)

       &uarr;   &uarr;

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

## Solution
Compare corresponding bits of `x` and `y` directly. If the bits are different, add the Hamming distance by 1. Finally, return the Hamming distance.
