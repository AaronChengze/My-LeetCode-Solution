# 470. Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a function `rand7` which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function `rand10` which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

Do NOT use system's `Math.random()`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1

**Output:** [7]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 2

**Output:** [8,4]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 3

**Output:** [8,1,10]

**Note:**

1. `rand7` is predefined.
2. Each testcase has one argument: `n`, the number of times that `rand10` is called.

**Follow up:**

1. What is the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) for the number of calls to `rand7()` function?
2. Could you minimize the number of calls to `rand7()`?

## Solution
Call `rand7` twice, and the two numbers obtained have 49 different permutations that have the same probability, and each permutation has a number from 0 to 48. If the number is greater than or equal to 40, then do the process again until the number is less than 40. Then an integer in the range 1 to 10 can be obtained where each number has the same probability.
