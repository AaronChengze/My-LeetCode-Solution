# 481. Magical String
## Level

## Description
A magical string **S** consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string **S** is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string **S** itself.

The first few elements of string **S** is the following: **S** = "1221121221221121122……"

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in **S**, it will be:

1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the **S** itself.

Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string **S**.

**Note:** N will not exceed 100,000.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 6

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.

## Solution
For an integer that doesn't exceed 10^9, it may have at most 32 bits.

For the `i`-th bit, if there are `x` numbers that have the `i`-th bit 1 and `y` numbers that have the `i`-th bit 0, then the total Hammindg distance for the `i`-th bit is `x * y`.

Therefore, loop over `nums` and for each bit, count the number of 1's of the bit to obtain the total Hamming distance of the bit. Sum up the total Hamming distances of all the bits to obtain the total Hamming distance that is the result.
