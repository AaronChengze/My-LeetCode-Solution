## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,1,0,1,1,1]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

**Note:**

* The input array will only contain `0` and `1`.
* The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

## Solution
Initialize the counter of consecutive ones to 0 and the max consecutive ones to 0. Loop over the array. If a number 1 is met, add the counter by 1 and update the max consecutive ones. If a number 0 is met, reset the counter to 0. Finally, return the max consecutive ones.
