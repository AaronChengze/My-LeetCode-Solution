# 491. Increasing Subsequences
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing subsequence should be at least 2.

**Example:**

**Input:** [4, 6, 7, 7]

**Output:** [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]

**Note:**

1. The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
2. The range of integer in the given array is [-100,100].
3. The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.

## Solution
First obtain all increasing subsequences that have length 2 and add them to the result list. Add them to the queue as well. Also use a queue to store the last index of each increasing subsequence. For each increasing subsequence, find whether there is a number after its last index that is greater than its last number. If so, a new subsequence with length increased by 1 is found, and offer the new subsequence to the queue and offer the new index to the queue of indices.

To avoid duplicates, use a set to store all the increasing subsequences that are met so far.

Finally, return the result list.
