# 493. Reverse Pairs
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array `nums`, we call `(i, j)` an ***important reverse pair*** if `i < j` and `nums[i] > 2*nums[j]`.

You need to return the number of important reverse pairs in the given array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,3,2,3,1]

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [2,4,3,5,1]

**Output:** 3

**Note:**
1. The length of the given array will not exceed `50,000`.
2. All the numbers in the input array are in the range of 32-bit integer.

## Solution
Use the idea of merge sort. In merge sort, the original array is split into two parts, each of which is sorted, and then merged. Suppose the two parts have already been sorted. Before merging the two parts, if there exists an index `i` in the left part and an index `j` in the right part such that `nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]`, then all indices from `i` to the end of the left part have numbers greater than `2 * nums[j]`, so increase the count accordingly.
