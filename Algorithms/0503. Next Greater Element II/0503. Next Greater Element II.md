# 503. Next Greater Element II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,1]

**Output:** [2,-1,2]

**Explanation:** The first 1's next greater number is 2.

The number 2 can't find next greater number.

The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

**Note:** The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

## Solution
Initialize each number's next greater element to -1.

Loop over the array and use a stack to store the greatest number so far. If the current number is greater than the top element of the stack (while stack is not empty), then update the top element's next greater number to be the current number and pop the number from the stack. Repeat the procedure until the stack is empty or the stack's top element is greater than or equal to the current number, and then push the current number into the stack.

Since the array is circular, loop over the array for two rounds so that the first greater number to each number's traversing order next can be found.
