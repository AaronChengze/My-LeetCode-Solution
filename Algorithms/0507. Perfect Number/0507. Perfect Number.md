# 507. Perfect Number
## Level
Easy

## Description
We define the Perfect Number is a **positive integer** that is equal to the sum of all its **positive** divisors except itself.

Now, given an **integer** n, write a function that returns true when it is a perfect number and false when it is not.

**Example:**

**Input:** 28

**Output:** True

**Explanation:** 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

**Note:** The input number **n** will not exceed 100,000,000. (1e8)

## Solution
An equivalent definition of the Perfect Number is a positive integer that is half of the sum of all its positive divisors including itself.

Do prime factorization for the given integer n such that n can be written as n = p_1^alpha_1 * p_2^alpha_2 * p_3^alpha_3 * ... * p_n^alpha_n, where p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n are different prime factors of n. The sum of all factors of n is S = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + p_1^3 + ... + p_1^alpha_1) * (1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + p_2^3 + ... + p_2^alpha_2) * (1 + p_3 + p_3^2 + p_3^3 + ... + p_3^alpha_3) * ... * (1 + p_n + p_n^2 + p_n^3 + ... + p_n^alpha_n). Return `true` if and only if `S == 2 * n`.
