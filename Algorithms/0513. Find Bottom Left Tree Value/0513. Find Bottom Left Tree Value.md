# 513. Find Bottom Left Tree Value
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, find the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Output:
1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:

        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   5   6
       /
      7

Output:
7
```
**Note:** You may assume the tree (i.e., the given root node) is not **NULL**.

## Solution
Use breadth first search. In each iteration of breadth first search, all nodes have the same value. As long as there are nodes that are not visited yet, there are nodes with a larger depth.
Use a queue to store the nodes. In each iteration, get the size of the queue, which represents the number of nodes in the current depth. The first node is the leftmost node in the current level, so store the value of the first node as the leftmost value. The leftmost value is updated in each iteration to make sure that it will be the leftmost value in the last row of the tree after visiting all nodes in the tree.
