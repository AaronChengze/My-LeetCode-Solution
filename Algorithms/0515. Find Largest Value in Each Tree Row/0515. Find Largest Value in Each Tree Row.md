Medium

## Description
You need to find the largest value in each row of a binary tree.

**Example:**
```
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       / \   \  
      5   3   9 

Output: [1, 3, 9]
```

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Each time all nodes in the same row are visited, and the largest value in the row can be obtained, which is added to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
