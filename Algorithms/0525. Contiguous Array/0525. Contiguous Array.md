# 525. Contiguous Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [0,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [0,1,0]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Note:** The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

## Solution
If `nums` has length 0, then return 0.

Use a map to store each subarray's counter, where each subarray's start index is 0, and the counter means the number of 1's in the subarray minus the number of 0's in the subarray. Loop over `nums` once. For each index `i`, obtain the number `nums[i]`, and add 1 to `counter` if the number is 1 or add -1 to `counter` if the number is 0, where `counter` is the counter of the subarray that ends in the current index. If `counter` equals 0`, then the current maximum length is `i + 1`, so update the maximum length as `i + 1`. Otherwise, if the map contains the key `counter`, obtain the maximum possible length of a subarray that ends at `i` and has counter 0, and update the maximum length. Finally, return the maximum length.
