# 528. Random Pick with Weight
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `w` of positive integers, where `w[i]` describes the weight of index `i`, write a function `pickIndex` which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1. `1 <= w.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
3. `pickIndex` will be called at most `10000` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

["Solution","pickIndex"]

[[[1]],[]]

**Output:** [null,0]

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]

[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]

**Output:** [null,0,1,1,1,0]

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array `w`. `pickIndex` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

## Solution
Create an array `accumulatedWeights` to store accumulated weights. In the constructor, calculate `accumulatedWeights` using the given parameter `w`, where `accumulatedWeights[i]` equals the sum of `w[0]` to `w[i]`. Also obtain the total weight in the constructor.

Each time `pickIndex` is called, select a random non-negative integer `random` that is less than the total weight. Then use binary search to find the maximum possible value of `index` such that `accumulatedWeights[index] < random`, and return `index`.
