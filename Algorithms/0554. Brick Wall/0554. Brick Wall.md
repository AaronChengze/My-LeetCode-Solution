# 554. Brick Wall
## Level
Medium

## Description
There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the **top** to the **bottom** and cross the **least** bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

**You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.**

**Example:**
```
Input: [[1,2,2,1],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [2,4],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,1,1]]

Output: 2

**Note:**

1. The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
2. The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

## Solution
For each row, for each block, obtain the accumulated width and use a map to store each width's count. For example, if a row's blocks are `[1,2,2,1]`, then the accumulated widths are `[1,3,4,6]`. Since a line can only be drawn in the middle, only consider the accumulated widths that are not the two vertical edges.

After all the rows are looped, loop over all the keys in the set and obtain the maximum count, which means that at this accumulated width there are the most number of edges of bricks. The number of bricks that are crossed equals the total number of rows minus the maximum count.
