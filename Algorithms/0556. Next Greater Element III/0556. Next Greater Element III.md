## Description
Given a positive **32-bit** integer **n**, you need to find the smallest **32-bit** integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer **n** and is greater in value than n. If no such positive **32-bit** integer exists, you need to return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 12

**Output:** 21

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 21

**Output:** -1

## Solution
Find the next permutation of the current integer, using the idea of solution to problem 47. If the current integer already has all digits permuted in descending order, then there doesn't exist an integer that uses the same digits and is greater than the current integer, so return -1. If the next number exceeds the range of a 32-bit integer, return false. If the next number exists and doesn't exceed the range of a 32-bit integer, return the next number.
