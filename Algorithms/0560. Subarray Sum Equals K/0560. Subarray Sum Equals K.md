# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1], k = 2

**Output:** 2

**Note:**
1. The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
2. The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer **k** is [-1e7, 1e7].

## Solution
Use a map to store each sum and the count of subarrays of the sum. Put sum 0 with count 1 to the map initially.

Loop over `nums` and calculate the total sum `sum`. For each `num` in `nums`, add `num` to `sum`, and obtain the count of subarrays with sum `sum - k`. Add the sum to the result. Then update the map with the count of subarrays with sum `sum`. Finally, return the result.
