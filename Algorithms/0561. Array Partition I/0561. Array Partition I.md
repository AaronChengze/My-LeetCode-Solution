# 561. Array Partition I
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into **n** pairs of integer, say (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>), (a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>), ..., (a<sub>n</sub>, b<sub>n</sub>) which makes sum of min(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,4,3,2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).

**Note:**
1. `n` is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

## Solution
Sort the array and calculate the sum lf aoo integers at even indices (index 0, index 2, index 4, ... index 2n-2).

Explanation to the solution is as follows. After sorting the array, the numbers are in the order `nums[0] <= nums[1] <= nums[2] <= ... <= nums[2 * n - 1]`. Obviously, `nums[0]` must be in one pair and must be the minimum element in the pair, so the minimum possible value for the maximum element in the pair is `nums[1]`, which prevents `nums[1]` from being the minimum element in any pair. After the pair `(nums[0], nums[1])` is formed, the remaining minimum element is `nums[2]`, and select `nums[3]` to be in the same pair as `nums[2]` similarly. So to obtain the maximum sum, select `nums[0]`, `nums[2]`, `nums[4]`, ..., `nums[2 * n - 2]`.
