# 567. Permutation in String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two strings **s1** and **s2**, write a function to return true if **s2** contains the permutation of **s1**. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the **substring** of the second string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"

**Output:** True

**Explanation:** s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"

**Output:** False

**Note:**

1. The input strings only contain lower case letters.
2. The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].

## Solution
If `s1.length() > s2.length()`, then it is impossible that **s2** contains a permutation of **s1**, so return `false`.

One string is a permutation of another string if and only if the number of occurrences of each character is the same in both strings. Therefore, for each substring in **s2** that has the same length as **s1**, calculate the substring's numbers of occurrences of all characters and check whether the numbers of occurrences of all characters are equal to the numbers of occurrences of all characters in **s1**. If there exists at least one such substring, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
