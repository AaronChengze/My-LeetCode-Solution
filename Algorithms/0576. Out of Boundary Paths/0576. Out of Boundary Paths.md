# 576. Out of Boundary Paths
## Level
Medium

## Description
There is an **m** by **n** grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate **(i,j)** of the ball, you can move the ball to **adjacent** cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can **at most** move **N** times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0

**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1

**Output:** 12

**Note:**

1. Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
2. The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
3. N is in range [0,50].

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `counts` with `m` rows and `n` columns, and initialize `counts[i][j] = 1` (while the other elements are all 0).

Loop for `K` times to find the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. Each time create a new 2D array `curCounts`. For each cell in `counts`, obtain the element `count` from the cell in `counts` and obtain all the 4 positions that can be reached in one move, and for each move, if the destination is inside the grid, then update the count of the destination in `curCounts` accordingly. Otherwise, increase the number of paths by `count`. After each time, copy all the elements from `curCounts` to `counts`.

Finally, return the number of paths.
