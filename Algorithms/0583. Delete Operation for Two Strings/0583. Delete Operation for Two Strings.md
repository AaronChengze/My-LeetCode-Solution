# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of steps required to make *word1* and *word2* the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "sea", "eat"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".

**Note:**
1. The length of given words won't exceed 500.
2. Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.

## Solution
Only the letters in the longest common subsequence needn't be deleted. All the other letters have to be deleted. So the solution is to obtain the length of the longest common subsequence of *word1* and *word2*, calculate the numbers of letters that have to be deleted in *word1* and *word2* respectively, and return the sum of the numbers of letters that have to be deleted.
