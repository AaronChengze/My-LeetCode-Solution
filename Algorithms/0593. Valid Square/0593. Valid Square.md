## Description
Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could construct a square.

The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.

**Example:**

**Input:** p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]

**Output:** True

Note:

1. All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
2. A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
3. Input points have no order.

## Solution
Since four points are given, there are six combinations of two points out of four. For the six pairs of points, calculate the distances between each pair of points, and sort the distances. The four points can construct a square if and only if the following requirements are met.

1. All four sides are equal with positive length.
2. The two diagonals are equal with positive length.
3. A diagonal has a greater length than a side.

Therefore, check whether the four shorter distances are equal and whether the two longer distances are equal, and return the result.
