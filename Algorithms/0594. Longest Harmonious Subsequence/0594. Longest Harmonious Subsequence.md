# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence
## Level
Easy

## Description
We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].

**Note:** The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.

## Solution
Count the number of occurrences for each element in the array. For each number `num` in the array, obtain its number of occurrences and obtain the number of occurrences for `num - 1` and `num + 1`. A harmonious subsequence either contains `num - 1` and `num` or contains `num` and `num + 1`, so consider the two cases and obtain the longest harmonious subsequence's length.
