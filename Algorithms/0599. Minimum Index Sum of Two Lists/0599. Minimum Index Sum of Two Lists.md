# 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists
## Level
Easy

## Description
Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their **common interest** with the **least list index sum**. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]

["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]

**Output:** ["Shogun"]

**Explanation:** The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]

["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]

**Output:** ["Shogun"]

**Explanation:** The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).

**Note:**
1. The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
2. The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
3. The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
4. No duplicates in both lists.

## Solution
Use a map to store each restaurant in `list1` and its corresponding index. Then loop over `list2`. If a restaurant in `list2` is also in `list1`, then calculate the list index sum, and store the least list index sum. Finally, return one or more restaurants with the least list index sum.
