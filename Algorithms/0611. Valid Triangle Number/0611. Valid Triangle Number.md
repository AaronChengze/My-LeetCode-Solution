# 611. Valid Triangle Number
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array consists of non-negative integers, your task is to count the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3
```

**Note:**
1. The length of the given array won't exceed 1000.
2. The integers in the given array are in the range of [0, 1000].

## Solution
Sort the array in ascending order. Skip the elements that are 0, and only consider the elements that are greater than 0.

Use nested loops to count the number of valid triangles. If the third number is already greater than or equal to the sum of the other two numbers, then break and go to another pair of the other two numbers.
