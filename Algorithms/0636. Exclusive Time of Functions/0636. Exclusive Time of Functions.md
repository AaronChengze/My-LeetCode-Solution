# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions
## Level
Medium

## Description
On a **single threaded** CPU, we execute some functions. Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.

We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.

Each log is a string with this format: `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`. For example, `"0:start:3"` means the function with id `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`. `"1:end:2"` means the function with id `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`.

A function's *exclusive* time is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does **not** include any recursive calls to child functions.

The CPU is **single threaded** which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.

Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

n = 2

logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]

**Output:** [3, 4]

**Explanation:**

Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.

Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.

Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 

So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= n <= 100`
2. Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
3. Functions will always log when they exit.

## Solution
Use a stack to store the function ids. The top of the stack is always the id of the function that started most recently.

If a log is the start of a function, then peek the previous function's id if the stack is not empty, and add the time lapse to the previous function's exclusive time. Then push the function's id into the stack.

If a log is the end of a function, then add the timestamp by 1 since the end of the timestamp is considered, and add the time lapse to the function's exclusive time.

After each log is visited, always update the previous timestamp to be the current timestamp.

Finally, return the result array.
