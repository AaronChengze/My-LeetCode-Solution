# 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given `n` pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.

Now, we define a pair `(c, d)` can follow another pair `(a, b)` if and only if `b < c`. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]

**Note:**
1. The number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].

## Solution
Sort the pairs according to the first numbers. Then use dynamic programming. Create an array `dp` with length `n`, where `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of pair chain that ends at index `i`. Initially, `dp[i] = 1` for all `0 <= i < n`. Then for each `i > 0`, loop over all `0 <= j < i`, and for each `j` such that `pairs[j][1] < pairs[i][0]`, there is `dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. Finally, return the maximum value in `dp`.
