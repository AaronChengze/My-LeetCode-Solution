## Description
Initially on a notepad only one character 'A' is present. You can perform two operations on this notepad for each step:

1. `Copy All`: You can copy all the characters present on the notepad (partial copy is not allowed).
2. `Paste`: You can paste the characters which are copied **last time**.

Given a number `n`. You have to get **exactly** `n` 'A' on the notepad by performing the minimum number of steps permitted. Output the minimum number of steps to get `n` 'A'.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Intitally, we have one character 'A'.

In step 1, we use Copy All operation.

In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.

In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.

**Note:**

1. The `n` will be in the range [1, 1000].

## Solution
If `n` is 1, then no operation is needed, so return 0.

If `n` is a prime number, then to get `n` 'A', 1 operation of `Copy All` and `n - 1` operations of `Paste` are needed, so the minimum number of steps is `n`.

If `n` is a composite number, then suppose `n` can be represented by the product of `k` prime numbers such that `n = p1 * p2 * ... * pk`, where each prime number is at least 2 and it is possible that several prime numbers are equal. To get `p1` 'A', the number of steps needed is `p1`. After `p1` 'A' are obtained, to get `p1 * p2` 'A', do 1 `Copy All` operation and `p2 - 1` `Paste` operations, which costs the minimum number of steps, so the total number of steps to obtain `p1 * p2` 'A' is `p1 + p2`. Similarly, the total number of steps to obtain `n` 'A' is `p1 + p2 + ... + pk`.

So the solution is to do prime factorization on `n` and get the list of prime factors that have a product equal to `n`, and calculate the sum of all the prime factors.
