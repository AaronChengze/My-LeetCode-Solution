# 660. Remove 9
## Level
Hard

## Description
Start from integer 1, remove any integer that contains 9 such as 9, 19, 29...

So now, you will have a new integer sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ...

Given a positive integer `n`, you need to return the n-th integer after removing. Note that 1 will be the first integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 9

**Output:** 10

**Hint:** n will not exceed `9 x 10^8`.

## Solution
In the new integer sequence, the n-th number is just `n` represented in base 9. So simply return the base 9 representation of number `n`.
