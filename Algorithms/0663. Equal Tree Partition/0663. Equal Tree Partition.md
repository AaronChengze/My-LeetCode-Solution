# 663. Equal Tree Partition
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree with `n` nodes, your task is to check if it's possible to partition the tree to two trees which have the equal sum of values after removing **exactly** one edge on the original tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:     
    5
   / \
  10 10
    /  \
   2   3

Output: True
Explanation: 
    5
   / 
  10
      
Sum: 15

   10
  /  \
 2    3

Sum: 15
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:     
    1
   / \
  2  10
    /  \
   2   20

Output: False
Explanation: You can't split the tree into two trees with equal sum after removing exactly one edge on the tree.
```

**Note:**
1. The range of tree node value is in the range of [-100000, 100000].
2. 1 <= n <= 10000

## Solution
If the tree is empty, return `false`.

Do breadth first search on the tree and store all the nodes in the order that they are visited. Then loop over all the nodes in the reversing order and for each node, add its children's values to its value. After the step, each node's value represents the sum of all the nodes' values in the subtree where the node is the root, and the root's value represents the sum lf all the nodes' values in the tree. If the root's value is odd, then it is not possible to partition the tree to two trees which have the equal sum of values, so return `false`. Otherwise, do breadth first search on the tree again. If there exists a node that has a value equal to half the root's value, then removing the edge connecting this node and its parent will partition the tree to two trees which have the equal sum of values, so return `true`. If no such node is found, return `false`.
