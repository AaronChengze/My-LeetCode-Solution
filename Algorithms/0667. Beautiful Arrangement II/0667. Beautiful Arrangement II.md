## Description
Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list which contains `n` different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and obeys the following requirement:

Suppose this list is [a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub>], then the list [|a<sub>1</sub> - a<sub>2</sub>|, |a<sub>2</sub> - a<sub>3</sub>|, |a<sub>3</sub> - a<sub>4</sub>|, ... , |a<sub>n-1</sub> - a<sub>n</sub>|] has exactly `k` distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 1

**Output:** [1, 2, 3]

**Explanation:** The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2

**Output:** [1, 3, 2]

**Explanation:** The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.

**Note:**

1. The `n` and `k` are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 10<sup>4</sup>.

## Solution
First create an array `sorted` of length `n` such that `sorted[i] = i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n`. Then create an array `arrangement` and add the elements into `arrangement` to make it obey the requirement.

Since there are exactly `k` distinct absolute differences between each pair of adjacent elements, let the absolute differences be `k`, `k - 1`, `k - 2`, ..., 1. Therefore, arrange the first `k + 1` elements to be `[1, k + 1, 2, k, 3, k - 1, ...]`, and there are `k` different absolute differences from 1 to `k`. Then put the remaining elements from `sorted` into `arrangement` with the same indices, where each pair of elements has an absolute difference 1, and `arrangement[k]` and `arrangement[k + 1]` has an absolute difference not greater than `k`.

Finally, return `arrangement`.
