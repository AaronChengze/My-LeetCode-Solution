## Description
Given a non-negative integer, you could swap two digits at **most once** to get the maximum valued number. Return the maximum valued number you could get.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 2736

**Output:** 7236

**Explanation:** Swap the number 2 and the number 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 9973

**Output:** 9973

**Explanation:** No swap.

**Note:**

## Solution
Use selection sort. Convert the given `num` into an array of `char` type. Loop over the array from left to right. For each digit in the array, find the largest digit in its right subarray with the largest index. If the largest digit is greater than the current digit, then swap the two digits. Since the swapping operation can be done at most once, if a swapping operation is done, stop sorting immediately. Then generate the new number from the updated array and return.
