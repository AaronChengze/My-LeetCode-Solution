# 686. Repeated String Match
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times ("abcdabcdabcd"), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

**Note:**

The length of `A` and `B` will be between 1 and 10000.

## Solution
If the repeated string has length greater than or equal to `A.length() * 2 + B.length()`, then the string's length is sufficient to determine whether B is a substring of the repeated string. If B is not a substring, then repeating even more times won't make B a substring of the repeated string.

Therefore, initialize a repeated string which is empty, and each time append A to the repeated string until B is a substring of the repeated string or the repeated string has a length greater than the necessary length. Return the repeated times if B is a substring of the repeated string, or return -1 otherwise.
