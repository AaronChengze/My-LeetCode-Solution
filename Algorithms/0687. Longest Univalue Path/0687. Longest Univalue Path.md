# 687. Longest Univalue Path
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
```
              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
```
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
```
              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
```
**Output:** 2

**Note:** The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.

## Solution
Use a global variable `ans` to store the final answer. Use recursion to calculate the `arrowLength` in each subtree.

If a node is empty, then obviously the `arrowLength` is 0. If a node has a child that is not empty and the child's value is the same as the node's value, then the `arrowLength` of the node equals the `arrowLength` of the child plus 1. Each node has two `arrowLength`s, for the left child and the right child respectively. If both the left `arrowLength` and the right `arrowLength` are positive, then the node and its two children have the same value, so the current path length can be the sum of both `arrowLength`s. Update `ans` with the current length.
