# 697. Degree of an Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers `nums`, the **degree** of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of `nums`, that has the same degree as nums.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation: **

The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.

Of the subarrays that have the same degree:

[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]

The shortest length is 2. So return 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]

**Output:** 6

**Note:**

* `nums.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.
* `nums[i]` will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.

## Solution
First get each number's frequency in array `nums`. Next obtain the numbers with the maximum frequency. Then for each number with the maximum frequency, obtain the first occurrence `minIndex` and the last occurrence `maxIndex` of the number, and the subarray with this number has length `maxIndex - minIndex + 1`. Finally, return the minimum possible length among the subarrays of each number with maximum frequency.
