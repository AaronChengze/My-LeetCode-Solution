# 713. Subarray Product Less Than K
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an array of positive integers `nums`.

Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than `k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].

Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

**Note:**

* `0 < nums.length <= 50000`.
* `0 < nums[i] < 1000`.
* `0 <= k < 10^6`.

## Solution
Initialize `product = 1`, `count = 0`, `start = 0` and `end = 0`. Loop over `nums` using `end` as the index. Each time let `product *= nums[end]`. If `product >= k`, then do `product /= nums[start++]` until `product < k`. Then calculate the length of the current subarray, which is `end - start + 1`. The length of the current subarray is also the number of subarrays with product less than `k` and ends at index `end`. Add the length of the current subarray to `count`. Finally, return `count`.
