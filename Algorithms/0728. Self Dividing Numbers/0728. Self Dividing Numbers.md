# 728. Self Dividing Numbers
## Level
Easy

## Description
A *self-dividing number* is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

left = 1, right = 22

**Output:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]

**Note:**

* The boundaries of each input argument are `1 <= left <= right <= 10000`.

## Solution
For each number in the range `[left, right]`, check whether the number is a self-dividing number.

To check whether a number is a self-dividing number, loop over all its digits and check each digit. If there exists a digit that is 0 or a digit such that the number is not divisible by the digit, then the number is not a self-dividing number. Otherwise, the number is a self-dividing number.
