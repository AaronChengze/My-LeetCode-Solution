# 729. My Calendar I
## Level
Medium

## Description
Implement a `MyCalendar` class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

Your class will have the method, `book(int start, int end)`. Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers x such that `start <= x < end`.

A *double booking* happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to both events.)

For each call to the method `MyCalendar.book`, return `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

Your class will be called like this: `MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar();` `MyCalendar.book(start, end)`

**Example 1:**
```
MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(20, 30); // returns true
Explanation: 
The first event can be booked.  The second can't because time 15 is already booked by another event.
The third event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
```

**Note:**

* The number of calls to `MyCalendar.book` per test case will be at most `1000`.
* In calls to `MyCalendar.book(start, end)`, `start` and `end` are integers in the range `[0, 10^9]`.

## Solution
Use a list to store the intervals of booking, which contains all intervals in sorted order. Each time `book(int start, int end)` is called, loop over the list of intervals to see whether the new interval `[start, end)` can be added. If the new interval can be added at the start or at the end without causing a double booking, add the new interval at the start or at the end and return `true`. If the new interval can be added between two intervals without causing a double booking, add the new interval between the two intervals and return `true`. If the new interval has intersection with any interval in the list, then adding the interval will cause double booking, so return `false`.
