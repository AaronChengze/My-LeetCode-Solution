# 738. Monotone Increasing Digits
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a non-negative integer `N`, find the largest number that is less than or equal to `N` with monotone increasing digits.

(Recall that an integer has *monotone increasing digits* if and only if each pair of adjacent digits `x` and `y` satisfy `x <= y`.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 10

**Output:** 9

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 1234

**Output:** 1234

**Example 3:**

**Input:** N = 332

**Output:** 299

**Note:** `N` is an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.

## Solution
Compare each pair of adjacent digits of `N` from right to left. If the left digit is greater than the right digit, decrease the left digit by 1 so that the left digit has the greatest possible value to have a number with monotone increasing digits at the current time. After the most significant digit that needs to decrease is determined, decrease the most significant digit by 1, and set all the lower digits to 9.
