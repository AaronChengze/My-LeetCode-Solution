# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a list of sorted characters `letters` containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter `target`, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is `target = 'z'` and `letters = ['a', 'b']`, the answer is `'a'`.

**Examples:**
```
Input:
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "a"
Output: "c"

Input:
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "c"
Output: "f"

Input:
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "d"
Output: "f"

Input:
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "g"
Output: "j"

Input:
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "j"
Output: "c"

Input:
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "k"
Output: "c"
```
**Note:**
1. `letters` has a length in range `[2, 10000]`.
2. `letters` consists of lowercase letters, and contains at least 2 unique letters.
3. `target` is a lowercase letter.

## Solution
First check whether `target` is greater than or equal to the last letter in `letters`. If so, according to the rule that letters wrap around, return the first letter from `letters`, which is `letter[0]`.

Set the `target` to be the letter next to it, and use the new `target` to do binary search. The return value of binary search is the index of the `target` if `target` is in `letters` or the index where the `target` should be inserted if `target` is not in `letters`. After the return index `index` of binary search is obtained, return `letters[index]`.
