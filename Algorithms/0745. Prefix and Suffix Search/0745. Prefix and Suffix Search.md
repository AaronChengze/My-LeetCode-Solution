# 745. Prefix and Suffix Search
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given many `words`, `words[i]` has weight `i`.

Design a class `WordFilter` that supports one function, `WordFilter.f(String prefix, String suffix)`. It will return the word with given `prefix` and `suffix` with maximum weight. If no word exists, return -1.

**Examples:**
```
Input:
WordFilter(["apple"])
WordFilter.f("a", "e") // returns 0
WordFilter.f("b", "") // returns -1
```

**Note:**

1. `words` has length in range `[1, 15000]`.
2. For each test case, up to `words.length` queries `WordFilter.f` may be made.
3. `words[i]` has length in range `[1, 10]`.
4. `prefix, suffix` have lengths in range `[0, 10]`.
5. `words[i]` and `prefix, suffix` queries consist of lowercase letters only.

## Solution
Use trie, where implementation is the same as solution to problem 208, except that for each node, there is not a data field that indicates whether the current node is the end of a word, and a new data field is introduced that represents the current node's weight.

Since suffix is introduced, use a new character `'{'` for splitting. For example, for the word "apple", add "{apple", "e{apple", "le{apple", "ple{apple", "pple{apple" and "apple{apple" into the trie.

When calling `f` using `prefix` and `suffix` as the parameter, search the string `suffix + "{" + prefix" in the trie and return the maximum weight, or return -1 if the string does not exist in the trie.
