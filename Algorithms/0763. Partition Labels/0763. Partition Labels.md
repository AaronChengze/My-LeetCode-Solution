## Description
A string `S` of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"

**Output:** [9,7,8]

**Explanation:**

The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".

This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.

A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

**Note:**

1. `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
2. `S` will consist of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.

## Solution
Loop over string `S` and store the last index in `S` for each lowercase letter. Initialize `start` and `end` to be both 0. Then loop over `S` and for each letter, obtain its last index `curEnd`, and update `end = Math.max(end, curEnd)`. The last index of the current partition must be at least `end`, or otherwise the letter at index `end` will be in another part of the partition and the current part will have the same letter, which means the same letter appears in more than one part. If after updating, the current index `i` in `S` equals `end`, then the end of the current part is met, so add the current part's length to the result list, and update `start = i + 1` to move on to the next part. Finally, return the result list.
