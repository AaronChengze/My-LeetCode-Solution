# 767. Reorganize String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string `S`, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.

If possible, output any possible result. If not possible, return the empty string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "aab"

**Output:** "aba"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** S = "aaab"

**Output:** ""

**Note:**

* `S` will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range `[1, 500]`.

## Solution
Count the number of occurrences in `S` of each letter. If the maximum number of occurrences is greater than `(S.length() + 1) / 2`, then it is impossible to rearrange the string to make all adjacent characters be different, so return the empty string.

Maintain an even index that is initially 0 and an odd index that is initially 1. If the string's length is odd and there is a letter that occurs `S.length() / 2 + 1` times, then the letter must be in all even indices. Otherwise, first consider putting the characters in odd indices and then in even indices. Do this for each letter. Since odd indices are not adjacent and even indices are not adjacent, it is guaranteed that the adjacent letters are not the same.

Finally, return the rearranged string.
