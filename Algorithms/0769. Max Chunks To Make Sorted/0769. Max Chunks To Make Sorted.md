# 769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `arr` that is a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1]`, we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [4,3,2,1,0]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.

For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,0,2,3,4]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].

However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.

**Note:**

* `arr` will have length in range `[1, 10]`.
* `arr[i]` will be a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1]`.

## Solution
Since `arr` is a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1]`, if `arr` is sorted, then for any `0 <= i < arr.length`, there is `arr[i] == i`.

Loop over `arr` from left to right. At each position `i`, update `curMax` as the current maximum value met in `arr[0..i]`. If `curMax == i`, then increase the number of chunks by 1. The reason is that once the current maximum value equals the current index `i`, it is guaranteed that `arr[0..i]` contains exactly all the elements from 0 to `i`, so if a chunk is split just after index `i`, the elements can be sorted. If `curMax > i`, then the element that equals `curMax` must be placed after index `i`, so splitting a chunk just after index `i` will make `curMax` never be at the correct index.

Finally, return the number of chunks.
