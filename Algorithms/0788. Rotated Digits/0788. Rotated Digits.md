# 788. Rotated Digits
## Level
Easy

## Description
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number `N`, how many numbers X from `1` to `N` are good?

**Example:**
```
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
```

**Note:**

* N will be in range `[1, 10000]`.

## Solution
For each number from 1 to `N`, check whether the number contains 3, 4 or 7. If so, rotating the number will result in an invalid number, so continue. If the number doesn't contain 3, 4 or 7, then check whether it contains 2, 5, 6 or 9. If so, rotating the number will result in a different valid number, so add the counter by 1. Finally, return the counter.
