# 792. Number of Matching Subsequences
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given string `S` and a dictionary of words `words`, find the number of `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `S`.

**Example:**

**Input:**

S = "abcde"

words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".

**Note:**

* All words in `words` and `S` will only consists of lowercase letters.
* The length of `S` will be in the range of `[1, 50000]`.
* The length of `words` will be in the range of `[1, 5000]`.
* The length of `words[i]` will be in the range of `[1, 50]`.

## Solution
For each `word` in `words`, check whether it is a subsequence of `S`, and add the counter by 1 if a subsequence is met. Use the solution to problem 392 to do the subsequence check. Finally, return the counter.
