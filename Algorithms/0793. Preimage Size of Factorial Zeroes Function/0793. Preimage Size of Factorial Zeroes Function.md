# 793. Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function
## Level
Hard

## Description
Let `f(x)` be the number of zeroes at the end of `x!`. (Recall that `x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x`, and by convention, `0! = 1`.)

For example, `f(3) = 0` because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while `f(11) = 2` because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given `K`, find how many non-negative integers `x` have the property that `f(x) = K`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** K = 0

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** K = 5

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.

**Note:**

* `K` will be an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.

## Solution
Obviously, for any input `K`, the output is either 0 or 5. If the output is not 0, then for `x` such that `f(x) = K` and `x` is divisible by 5, there is `f(x + 1) = f(x + 2) = f(x + 3) = f(x + 4) = K` but `f(x + 5) = K + 1`, so the output is 5.

Thus the aim of the problem is to find whether there exists an `x` such that `f(x) = K`. If such an `x` is found, return 5. Otherwise, return 0.

Use binary search to solve this. Initially, let `low = 0` and `high = K * 5` since each multiple of 5 contains at least one factor 5 and will add one zero to the end of the factorial. The condition of binary search is `low <= high`. Each time let `mid` be the average of `low` and `high`, and calculate the number of zeroes at the end of the factorial of `mid`. If such a number equals `K`, then `mid` can be the input of `f(x)` to make `f(x) = K`, so return 5. If such a number is greater than `K`, then set `high = mid - 1`. If such a number is less than `K`, then set `low = mid + 1`. If no such an `x` is found, return 0.
