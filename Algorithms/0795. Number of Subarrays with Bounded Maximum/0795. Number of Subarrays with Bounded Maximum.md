# 795. Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum
## Level
Medium

## Description
We are given an array `A` of positive integers, and two positive integers `L` and `R` (`L <= R`).

Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least `L` and at most `R`.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
L = 2
R = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].
```

**Note:**

* L, R and `A[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.
* The length of `A` will be in the range of `[1, 50000]`.

## Solution
The idea is as follows. Given a `bound`, calculate the number of subarrays such that all the elements are less than or equal to `bound`. To achieve this, loop over the array `A`, and find the longest subarrays such that all the elements are less than or equal to `bound`. Here "longest" means that the two ends of the subarray are either at the ends of the array or the leftmost/rightmost elements that do not exceed `bound`. If a longest subarray has length `n`, then the number of nun-empty subarrays in the subarray is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

First calculate the number of subarrays of `A` when `bound = R`, and then calculate the number of subarrays of `A` when `bound = L - 1`, and return the difference between the two counts.
