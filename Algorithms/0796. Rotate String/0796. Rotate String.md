# 0796. Rotate String
## Level
Easy

## Description
We are given two strings, `A` and `B`.

A *shift on `A`* consists of taking string `A` and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if `A = 'abcde'`, then it will be `'bcdea'` after one shift on `A`. Return `True` if and only if `A` can become `B` after some number of shifts on `A`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'

**Output:** false

**Note:**

* `A` and `B` will have length at most `100`.

## Solution
String `A` can become string `B` after some number of shifts only if `A` and `B` has the same length. If the lengths are different, return `False`.

The shift exists if and only if `A` is a substring of the repeated version of `B` (`B + B`, for example, if `B` is `'cdeab'`, then the repeated version of `B` is `'cdeabcdeab'`). Therefore, repeat `B` and check whether `A` is a substring of the repeated version of `B`.
