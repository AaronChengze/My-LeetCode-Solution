# 814. Binary Tree Pruning
## Level
Medium

## Description
We are given the head node `root` of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,null,0,0,1]

**Output:** [1,null,0,null,1]

**Explanation:** Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1". The diagram on the right represents the answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]

**Output:** [1,null,1,null,1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]

**Output:** [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]

**Note:**

* The binary tree will have at most `100` nodes.
* The value of each node will only be `0` or `1`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search on the binary tree. Use a list to store all the nodes in the order that they are visited, and use a map to store each node's parent.

After all the nodes are visited, loop over the node list in reversing order. For each node, if its value is 0, then check whether it is a leaf. If it is a leaf, then obtain its parent from the map, and set the parent node's corresponding child to `null` if the parent is not `null` (for example, if the node is its parent's left child, then set the parent node's left child to `null`). If the parent is `null`, then the current node is the root, so set root to `null`.

Finally, return the root.
