# 837. New 21 Game
## Level
Medium

## Description
Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with `0` points, and draws numbers while she has less than `K` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, W]`, where `W` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points. What is the probability that she has N or less points?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 10, K = 1, W = 10

**Output:** 1.00000

**Explanation:** Alice gets a single card, then stops.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 6, K = 1, W = 10

**Output:** 0.60000

**Explanation:** Alice gets a single card, then stops.

In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** N = 21, K = 17, W = 10

**Output:** 0.73278

**Note:**

1. `0 <= K <= N <= 10000`
2. `1 <= W <= 10000`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create an array `dp` of length `N + W + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the probability when there are already `i` points. The target is to find `dp[0]`.

Obviously, `dp[i] = 1` for `K <= i <= N` and `dp[i] = 0` for `i > N`. For `i < K`, `dp[i] = (dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 2] + ... + dp[i + W]) / W`. It can be calculated that `dp[i] - dp[i - 1] = (dp[i + W] - dp[i]) / W`. Therefore, `dp[i]` can be calculated for `i` from `K - 1` to 0. Finally, return `dp[0]`.
