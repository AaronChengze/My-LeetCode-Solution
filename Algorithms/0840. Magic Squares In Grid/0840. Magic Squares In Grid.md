# 840. Magic Squares In Grid
## Level
Easy

## Description
A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers **from 1 to 9** such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given a `grid` of integers, how many 3 x 3 "magic square" subgrids are there?  (Each subgrid is contiguous).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[4,3,8,4],
        [9,5,1,9],
        [2,7,6,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:
438
951
276

while this one is not:
384
519
762

In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= grid.length <= 10`
* `1 <= grid[0].length <= 10`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`

## Solution
For each 3 x 3 subgrid, check whether it is a magic square, and return the number of magic squares.

To check whether a 3 x 3 subgrid is a magic square, first check that the middle number must be 5. If not, it can't be a magic square. Then check the sums in each row, each column and each diagonal and all the sums should be 15.
