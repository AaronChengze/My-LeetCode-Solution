# 845. Longest Mountain in Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a *mountain* if the following properties hold:

* `B.length >= 3`
* There exists some `0 < i < B.length - 1` such that `B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]`

(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array `A` of integers, return the length of the longest *mountain*.

Return `0` if there is no mountain.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [2,2,2]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no mountain.

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`

**Follow up:**
* Can you solve it using only one pass?
* Can you solve it in `O(1)` space?

## Solution
Create two arrays `ascending` and `descending`. Loop over `A` from left to right. For each index `i`, if `A[i] > A[i - 1]`, then set `ascending[i] = ascending[i - 1] + 1`. Loop over `A` from right to left. For each index `i`, if `A[i] > A[i + 1]`, then set `descending[i] = descending[i + 1] + 1`.

Loop over indices `i` from 1 to `length - 2`. For each index `i` , if `ascending[i] > 0` and `descending[i] > 0`, then there is a mountain where the peak element is at index `i`, so calculate the mountain's length as `ascending[i] + descending[i] + 1`, and update the maximum mountain's length. Finally, return the maximum mountain's length.
