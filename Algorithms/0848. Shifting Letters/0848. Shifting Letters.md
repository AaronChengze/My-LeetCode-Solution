# 848. Shifting Letters
## Level
Medium

## Description
We have a string `S` of lowercase letters, and an integer array `shifts`.

Call the *shift* of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`).Â 

For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i+1` letters of `S`, `x` times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `S` are applied.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]

**Output:** "rpl"

**Explanation:** 

We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of S by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of S by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of S by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= S.length = shifts.length <= 20000`
2. `0 <= shifts[i] <= 10 ^ 9`

## Solution
Calculate accumulative shifts for each index, from last to first. Since there are only 26 lowercase letters, the shifts should do modulo operation by 26.
After accumulative shifts are calculated, do the accumulative shifts for each index.
