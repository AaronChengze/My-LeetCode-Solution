# 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Let's call an array `A` a *mountain* if the following properties hold:

* `A.length >= 3`
* There exists some `0 < i < A.length - 1` such that `A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`

Given an array that is definitely a mountain, return any `i` such that `A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [0,1,0]

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [0,2,1,0]

**Output:** 1

**Note:**

1. `3 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`
3. A is a mountain, as defined above.

## Solution
Loop over the array from left to right. Since the array is a mountain, there exists a peak element, which is greater than both its adjacent elements. If such a peak element is found, return its index.
