# 856. Score of Parentheses
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a balanced parentheses string `S`, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:

* `()` has score 1
* `AB` has score `A + B`, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
* `(A)` has score `2 * A`, where A is a balanced parentheses string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "()"

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "(())"

**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "()()"

**Output:** 2

**Example 4:**

**Input:** "(()(()))"

**Output:** 6

**Note:**

1. `S` is a balanced parentheses string, containing only `(` and `)`.
2. `2 <= S.length <= 50`

## Solution
Use two stacks to store parentheses and scores respectively. Each time a `(` is met, push it into the parentheses stack, and push a 0 into the score stack. Each time a `)` is met, pop one element from the parentheses stack and pop the previous score from the score stack. If the previous score is 0, then the previous character is a `(`, so push 1 into the score stack. If the previous score is not 0, then there are nested parentheses, so pop the scores from the score stack and calculate the sum of the scores until a 0 is met, then pop the 0 and push the new score which equals the sum multiplied by 2 into the score stack.

Finally, calculate the sum of all scores in the score stack and return.
