# 858. Mirror Reflection
## Level
Medium

## Description
There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.  Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0`th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first. (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** p = 2, q = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= p <= 1000`
2. `0 <= q <= p`

## Solution
If the ray meets a receptor before reaching the top wall, which means `p % q == 0`, then the case is quite simple. Just calculate `p / q`. If the quotient is odd, then the ray meets receptor 1 first. If the quotient is even, then the ray meets receptor 2 first.

If the ray reaches the top wall, then the case is more complicated. In this case, extend the room at the top several times. At the left side, only receptor 2 exists. At the right side, receptor 1 is above receptor 0, and receptor 0 is above receptor 1. Therefore, receptor 0 and receptor 1 appear alternately. The solution is to find the least common multiple of `p` and `q`, which is the vertical distance from the bottom to the first receptor the ray meets. Le the least common multiple be `firstMeet`. The number of reflecting is `firstMeet / q`. If the number of reflecting is even, then a receptor at the left side is met first, so return 2. If the number of reflecting is odd, then calculate the number of squares that have been passed, which is `firstMeet / p`. If the number of squares that have been passed is even, return 0. If the number of squares that have been passed is odd, return 1.
