# 866. Prime Palindrome
## Level
Medium

## Description
Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `N`.

Recall that a number is *prime* if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 6

**Output:** 7

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 8

**Output:** 11

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 13

**Output:** 101

**Note:**

* `1 <= N <= 10^8`
* The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than `2 * 10^8`.

## Solution
First, find the smallest palindrome greater than or equal to `N`.

To find the next palindrome given `N`, suppose `N` has `d` digits, obtain the higher `(d + 1) / 2` digits of `N`, and generate a palindrome based on whether `d` is even. For example, suppose the highest 3 digits of `N` are `"123"`. If `d` is 5, then the palindrome is `"12321"`. If `d` is 6, then the palindrome is `"123321"`. If the palindrome is less than `N`, then find the next palindrome. For the examples above, the next palindromes are `"12421"` and `"124421"` respectively.

Then check whether the palindrome is prime. If not, obtain the next palindrome until a prime palindrome is met. Finally, return the prime palindrome.
