# 867. Transpose Matrix
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a matrix `A`, return the transpose of `A`.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over it's main diagonal, switching the row and column indices of the matrix.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

**Output:** [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]

**Output:** [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 1000`
2. `1 <= A[0].length <= 1000`

## Solution
Suppose matrix `A` has `r` rows and `c` columns, then create a matrix `B` that has `c` rows and `r` columns, which is a transpose of `A`. For each `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < r` and `0 <= j < c`, let `B[j][i] = A[i][j]`. Finally, return `B`.
