# 870. Advantage Shuffle
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two arrays `A` and `B` of equal size, the *advantage of* `A` *with respect to* `B` is the number of indices `i` for which `A[i] > B[i]`.

Return **any** permutation of `A` that maximizes its advantage with respect to `B`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [2,7,11,15], B = [1,10,4,11]

**Output:** [2,11,7,15]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [12,24,8,32], B = [13,25,32,11]

**Output:** [24,32,8,12]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length = B.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
3. `0 <= B[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution
Sort the array `B` with indices maintained. Sort the array `A` as well. For each element in `B`, find the smallest element in `A` that is greater than the element in `B`. This way can lead to the maximum advantage of `A` with respect to `B`. The reason is that using the smallest possible element in `A` can make sure that the current element in `A` is greater than one element in `B`, which can increase the advantage of `A` with respect to `B` by 1. If the current element in `A` is compared to another element in `B`, then it is possible that another element in `B` is greater so there will be a smaller advantage.

If there are remaining elements in `A`, put them to the end of `A`. After `A` is shuffled according to `B`, reorder the elements in `A` according to the order of indices and return.
