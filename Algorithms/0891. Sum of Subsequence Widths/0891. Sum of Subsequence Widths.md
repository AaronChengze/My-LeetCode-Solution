# 891. Sum of Subsequence Widths
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array of integers `A`, consider all non-empty subsequences of `A`.

For any sequence S, let the *width* of S be the difference between the maximum and minimum element of S.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of A. 

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [2,1,3]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

Subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].

The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.

The sum of these widths is 6.

**Note:**

* `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
* `1 <= A[i] <= 20000`

## Solution
First sort the array `A`, which won't affect the result. Then the sum of subsequence widths is the sum over `2 ^ (j - i - 1) * (A[j] - A[i])` for all pairs `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < j < A.length`. The result is the sum over `(2 ^ i - 2 ^ (A.length - i - 1)) * A[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `A.length - 1`.
