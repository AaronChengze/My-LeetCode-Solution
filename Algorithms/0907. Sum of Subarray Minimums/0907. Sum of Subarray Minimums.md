# 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `A`, find the sum of `min(B)`, where `B` ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of `A`.

Since the answer may be large, **return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,1,2,4]

**Output:** 17

**Explanation:** Subarrays are [3], [1], [2], [4], [3,1], [1,2], [2,4], [3,1,2], [1,2,4], [3,1,2,4]. 

Minimums are 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1.  Sum is 17.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 30000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 30000`

## Solution
Maintain two stacks of minimum values and the counts of minimum values, respectively. Loop over `A` from left to right. Initially, each value's count is 1. If the current value is less than the top element of the value stack, then pop the elements out of both stacks until both stacks become empty or the top element of the value stack is less than the current value. For each popped element, increase the count by the previous count. The sum is calculated as the sum of the products of all minimum values and their corresponding counts. If there are elements that are popped, then subtract the elements with their corresponding counts from the sum of products. Finally, return the sum.
