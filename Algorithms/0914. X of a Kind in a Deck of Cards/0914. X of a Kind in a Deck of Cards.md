# 914. X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards
## Level
Easy

## Description
In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return `true` if and only if you can choose `X >= 2` such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

* Each group has exactly `X` cards.
* All the cards in each group have the same integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** No possible partition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** No possible partition.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** [1,1]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Possible partition [1,1]

**Example 5:**

**Input:** [1,1,2,2,2,2]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= deck.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= deck[i] < 10000`

## Solution
First, for each integer that is written on at least one card, count how many cards have the integer written on it. If it is possible to split the entire deck according to the requirement, then the number of cards for each integer must be divisible by `X`. In other words, `X` is a common divisor of all the numbers of cards for all integers, and it is required that `X` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the solution is to find the greatest common divisor of all the number of cards for all integers. Return `true` if and only if the greatest common divisor is greater than 1.
