# 917. Reverse Only Letters
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `S`, return the "reversed" string where all characters that are not a letter stay in the same place, and all letters reverse their positions.

Example 1:

**Input:** "ab-cd"

**Output:** "dc-ba"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"

**Output:** "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"

**Output:** "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"

**Note:**

1. `S.length <= 100`
2. `33 <= S[i].ASCIIcode <= 122`
3. `S` doesn't contain `\` or `"`

## Solution
Use two pointers `low` and `high` that point to the start index and the end index of `S` initially. While the two pointers do not meet or cross each other, check the two characters at the two pointers. If the character that a pointer points to is not a letter, move the pointer towards the middle by 1 step. If both pointers point to letters, then swap the two letters at the two pointers. Finally, return the new string.
