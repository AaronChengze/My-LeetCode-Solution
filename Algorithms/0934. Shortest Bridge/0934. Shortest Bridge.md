## Description
In a given 2D binary array `A`, there are two islands. (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s not connected to any other 1s.)

Now, we may change `0`s to `1`s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.

Return the smallest number of `0`s that must be flipped. (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[0,1],[1,0]]

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]

**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]

**Output:** 1

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length = A[0].length <= 100`
2. `A[i][j] == 0 or A[i][j] == 1`

## Solution
Do two rounds of breadth first search.

In the first round, loop over the 2D array `A` and find the first occurrence of `1`, and do breadth first search starting from this occurrence of `1`. For all the cells with `1` that can be reached, including the starting cell, replace all the `1`'s with `2`'s, so that this island is different from the other island that has not been visited.

In the second round, do breadth first search starting from all the cells in the first island. If a `1` is met, then the shortest distance between the two islands is found. The length of the shortest bridge equals the shortest distance minus 1.
