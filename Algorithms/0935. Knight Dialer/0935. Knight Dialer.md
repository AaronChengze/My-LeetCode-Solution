This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes `N-1` hops. Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing `N` digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, **output the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1

**Output:** 10

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 2

**Output:** 20

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 3

**Output:** 46

**Note:**

* `1 <= N <= 5000`

## Solution
Use a map to store all its adjacent numbers that can be reached using a knight move. For example, the adjacent numbers of 4 are 0, 3 and 9, and there is no adjacent number of 5.

Use dynamic programming. Create an array `dp` with `N` rows and 10 columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of distinct numbers that can be dialed with length `i + 1` and the last number `j`. Initially, `dp[0][0]` to `dp[0][9]` are all 1. For `i > 0`, `dp[i][j]` is the sum of all the values `dp[i - 1][k]` where `k` is any adjacent number of `j`. For example, `dp[1][4] = dp[0][0] + dp[0][3] + dp[0][9]`. After the last row of `dp` is calculated, sum up the last row to obtain the answer. Output the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.
