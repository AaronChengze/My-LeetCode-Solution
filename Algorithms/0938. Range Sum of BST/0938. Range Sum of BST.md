# 938. Range Sum of BST
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given the `root` node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between `L` and `R` (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15

**Output:** 32

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10

**Output:** 23

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the tree is at most `10000`.
2. The final answer is guaranteed to be less than `2^31`.

## Solution
Obtain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree, which contains all the values in the binary search tree in ascending order. Find the indices of `L` and `R` respectively, and calculate the sum of all values between the indices inclusive. Finally, return the sum.
