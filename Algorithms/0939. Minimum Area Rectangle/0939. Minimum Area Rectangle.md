# 939. Minimum Area Rectangle
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.

If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]

**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]

**Output**: 2

**Note:**

1. `1 <= points.length <= 500`
2. `0 <= points[i][0] <= 40000`
3. `0 <= points[i][1] <= 40000`
4. All points are distinct.

## Solution
For each x-coordinate, obtain the list of y-coordinates. Then for each x-coordinate, obtain all pairs of y-coordinates, and check whether there exists a previous x-coordinate that has such pair of y-coordinates. If so, the previous x-coordinate is the closest one to the current x-coordinate, and calculate the minimum area. Finally, return the minimum area.
