# 942. DI String Match
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `S` that only contains "I" (increase) or "D" (decrease), let `N = S.length`.

Return **any** permutation `A` of `[0, 1, ..., N]` such that for all `i = 0, ..., N-1`:

* If `S[i] == "I"`, then `A[i] < A[i+1]`
* If `S[i] == "D"`, then `A[i] > A[i+1]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "IDID"

**Output:** [0,4,1,3,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "III"

**Output:** [0,1,2,3]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "DDI"

**Output:** [3,2,0,1]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= S.length <= 10000`
2. `S` only contains characters `"I"` or `"D"`.

## Solution
Create an array `array` with length `N + 1`. Initially, `array[0]` is 0. Maintain two variables `min` and `max` that stores the minimum element met so far and the maximum element met so far, which are both initially 0.

Loop over the string `S`. If a character `"I"` is met, then the next number is `max + 1`. If a character `"D"` is met, then the next number is `min - 1`. Update `max` and `min` after obtaining the next number. It is possible that `min` becomes negative.

After the string `S` is looped over, subtract `min` from all the numbers in `array` to make the minimum value in `array` become 0. Since each new number is either greater than the previous maximum value or less than the previous minimum value, there won't be duplicates. Also it is guaranteed that the maximum value in `array` and the minimum value in `array` differ by `N`. So return `array`.
