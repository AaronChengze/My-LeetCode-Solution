# 945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers A, a *move* consists of choosing any `A[i]`, and incrementing it by `1`.

Return the least number of moves to make every value in `A` unique.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,2]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,2,1,2,1,7]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 40000`
2. `0 <= A[i] < 40000`

## Solution
Obviously, if `A` has 0 or 1 element, then there is no duplicate element, so no move is needed, and return 0.

Since the order of elements in the array `A` does not matter, sort `A` in ascending order. The minimum element is `A[0]`. Let `curValue = A[0]`, where `curValue` represents the minimum possible value at each index if every value in `A` is unique. Loop over `i` from 1 to `A.length - 1`. At each index, update `curValue = Math.max(curValue + 1, A[i])`, which means `curValue` cannot be less than the original `A[i]`. The reason is that since `A` is sorted in ascending order, there does not exist an element `A[j]` such that `i < j` and `A[j] < A[i]`, so the next unique element is at least `A[i]`. The current value `A[i]` needs to be increased by `curValue - A[i]`, which is added to the number of moves. Finally, return the number of moves.
