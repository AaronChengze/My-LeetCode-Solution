# 951. Flip Equivalent Binary Trees
## Level
Medium

## Description
For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is *flip equivalent* to a binary tree Y if and only if we can make X equal to Y after some number of flip operations.

Write a function that determines whether two binary trees are *flip equivalent*. The trees are given by root nodes root1 and root2.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8], root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.

**Note:**

1. Each tree will have at most `100` nodes.
2. Each value in each tree will be a unique integer in the range `[0, 99]`.

## Solution
A solution using recursion is quite straightforward. This solution uses breadth first search without recursion.

If both trees are empty, then they are flip equivalent, so return `true`. If only one tree is empty, then return `false`.

Do breadth first search on two trees starting from both roots. Each time visit one node from each tree. If the two nodes visited at the same time do not have the same value, return `false`. Otherwise, check their children. If both nodes are leaf nodes without children, then stop further search. Otherwise, each node has at least one child. If the two nodes' numbers of children are different, return `false`. For convenience, if a node does not have a left child, then assign its right child to its left child and make its right child `null`. If both nodes have only one child, then check whether the first node's child and the second node's child have the same value, and return `false` if the values are different. If both nodes have two children, then flip the second node if the first node's left child has the same value as the second node's right child. Then do further search on the nodes' children, where the left child is visited before the right child.

If two trees are flip equivalent, then they must have the same number of nodes as well, which means the searching on the two trees should end at the same time. If this is not the case, return `false`.

If no conflict is met, return `true`.
