# 959. Regions Cut By Slashes
## Level
Medium

## Description
In a N x N `grid` composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a `/`, `\`, or blank space. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a `\` is represented as `"\\"`.)

Return the number of regions.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
[
  "\\/",
  "/\\"
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)

**Example 4:**
```
Input:
[
  "/\\",
  "\\/"
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)

**Note:**

1. `1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30`
2. `grid[i][j]` is either `'/'`, `'\'`, or `' '`.

## Solution
Since each cell may have a character space, `/` or `\`, divide each cell into four subcells. For each cell, if the character is a space, then all four subcells are in the same region. If the character is a `/` or `\`, then each group of two adjacent subcells must be in the same region.

For each subcell, all the adjacent subcells are in the same region as the subcell. Each subcell has at most one adjacent subcell that is outside the current cell, and all adjacent subcells must be in the same region.

Therefore, this problem can be solved using breadth first search. Starting from the top subcell of the top left cell, visit all the subcells that are in the same region (that is, all the subcells are reachable by visiting the adjacent subcells), and mark the subcells with the region number. When no more subcells in the same region are left, then increase the region number by 1, find the next subcell that has not been visited, and repeat the process above. The search is finished when there are no more unvisited subcells left. Finally, return the number of regions.
