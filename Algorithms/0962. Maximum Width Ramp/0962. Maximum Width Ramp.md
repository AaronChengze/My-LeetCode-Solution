# 962. Maximum Width Ramp
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `A` of integers, a *ramp* is a tuple `(i, j)` for which `i < j` and `A[i] <= A[j]`. The width of such a ramp is `j - i`.

Find the maximum width of a ramp in `A`. If one doesn't exist, return 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [6,0,8,2,1,5]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): A[2] = 1 and A[9] = 1.

**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 50000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 50000`

## Solution
Use two stacks to store numbers and indices respectively. Loop over `A` from left to right. If both stacks are empty, then push the current number and the current index into both stacks. If both stacks contains elements and the current number is less than the number at the top of the number stack, then push the current number and the current index into both stacks. Otherwise, pop both stacks until both stacks become empty or the number at the top of the number stack is greater than the current number. Then the index popped last is the minimum possible index of a ramp, and update the maximum width of a ramp using the current index and the index popped last. For the numbers and indices that are popped, push them back into the two stacks and remain the original order.

Finally, return the maximum width of a ramp.
