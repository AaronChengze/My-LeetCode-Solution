# 971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree with `N` nodes, each node has a different value from `{1, ..., N}`.

A node in this binary tree can be *flipped* by swapping the left child and the right child of that node.

Consider the sequence of `N` values reported by a preorder traversal starting from the root. Call such a sequence of `N` values the *voyage* of the tree.

(Recall that a *preorder traversal* of a node means we report the current node's value, then preorder-traverse the left child, then preorder-traverse the right child.)

Our goal is to flip the **least number** of nodes in the tree so that the voyage of the tree matches the `voyage` we are given.

If we can do so, then return a list of the values of all nodes flipped.  You may return the answer in any order.

If we cannot do so, then return the list `[-1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2], voyage = [2,1]

**Output:** [-1]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]

**Output:** [1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,2,3]

**Output:** []

## Solution
To make one point clear, if a node is flipped, then not only its two children, but also the two subtrees are swapped. For example, given a binary tree `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`, if the root node `1` is flipped, then the binary tree after flipping is `[1,3,2,6,null,4,5]`.

Consider under which circustances a node needs to be flipped. In preorder traversal, the left child is visited just after the root is visited if the left child is not `null`, which means the root is the first node to be visited and the left child is the second node to be visited if the left child is not `null`. Therefore, a node needs to be flipped only if it has two children, and the node to be visited after the node is its right child. In this case, do the flipping.

The whole process is to do preorder traversal on the original binary tree, using the solution to problem 144. Each time a node is visited, compare it with the value in `voyage`. If at one step, the current node in preorder traversal does not match the value in `voyage`, then the flipping is impossible, so return the list `[-1]`. Otherwise, check the next node in preorder traversal and the next value in `voyage` if the current node has two children. If the current node has two children and the next node in preorder traversal and the next value in `voyage` does not match, then flip the current node and add the current node's value to the result list. After flipping, the current node's two children are swapped and the order that they are visited is changed.

If the preorder traversal completes successfully, which means all the nodes in the binary tree match all the values in `voyage` exactly, return the result list. For other cases like `voyage`'s length does not equal the number of nodes in the binary tree, return the list `[-1]`.
