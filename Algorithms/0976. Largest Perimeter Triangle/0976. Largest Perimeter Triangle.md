# 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array `A` of positive lengths, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with **non-zero area**, formed from 3 of these lengths.

If it is impossible to form any triangle of non-zero area, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [2,1,2]

**Output:** 5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,1]

**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [3,2,3,4]

**Output:** 10

**Example 4:**

**Input:** [3,6,2,3]

**Output:** 8

**Note:**

1. `3 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 10^6`

## Solution
Sort the array, and each time obtain the three adjacent elements from the array from the greatest possible elements. Suppose the three elements are `x`, `y` and `z` where `x <= y <= z`. If `x + y > z`, then the three elements can form a triangle, so return the sum of the three elements. If no such three elements are found, return 0.

The reason why only considering adjacent elements are as follows. Suppose the three adjacent elements are `x`, `y` and `z` where `x <= y <= z`. If `x + y < z`, which means the three elements can't form a triangle, then selecting another element that is not adjacent will never form a triangle. For example, suppose `a` is to the left of `x` and `b` is to the right of `z`, then `a <= x` and `b >= z`, and there is `a + y <= x + y < z`, `x + y < z <= b`, and `a + y < z < b`, which means none of the tuples `(a, y, z)`, `(x, y, b)` and `(a, y, b)` can form a triangle. Therefore, only adjacent elements need to be considered.
