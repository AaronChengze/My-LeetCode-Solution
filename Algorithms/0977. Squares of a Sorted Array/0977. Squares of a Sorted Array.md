# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array of integers `A` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [-4,-1,0,3,10]

**Output:** [0,1,9,16,100]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [-7,-3,2,3,11]

**Output:** [4,9,9,49,121]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Solution
First find the integer in `A` that has the minimum absolute value, and add the integer's square to the result array. Then use two pointers to point to the negative integer that has the minimum absolute value and the positive integer that has the minimum value, respectively. Let `index1` point to the negative integer and `index2` point to the positive integer, respectively.

Each time, select the number with a smaller absolute value from the numbers that the two pointers point to, add its square to the result array, and move the corresponding pointer to the next integer with a greater absolute value (move `index1` to the left by 1 step or move `index2` to the right by 1 step).

If one pointer has reached the leftmost index or the rightmost index, then calculate the squares of the numbers of the other pointer, and add the squares to the result array.

Finally, return the result array.
