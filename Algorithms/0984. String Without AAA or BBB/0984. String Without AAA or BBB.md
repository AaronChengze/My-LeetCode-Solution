# 984. String Without AAA or BBB
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two integers `A` and `B`, return any string `S` such that:

* `S` has length `A + B` and contains exactly `A` `'a'` letters, and exactly `B` `'b'` letters;
* The substring `'aaa'` does not occur in `S`;
* The substring `'bbb'` does not occur in `S`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = 1, B = 2

**Output:** "abb"

**Explanation:** "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = 4, B = 1

**Output:** "aabaa"

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A <= 100`
2. `0 <= B <= 100`
3. It is guaranteed such an `S` exists for the given `A` and `B`.

## Solution
If `A` and `B` are not equal, then each time append two letters with the larger remaining counts and one letter with the smaller remaining counts. For example, while `A > B`, append `'aab'` each time. While `A < B`, append `'bba'` each time. Repeat the process until `A == B` or at least one of `A` and `B` becomes 0.

If `A == B`, then simply append `'ab'` until `A` and `B` become 0. If either `A` or `B` becomes 0 and the other integer is still positive, then append the corresponding letter until the other integer also becomes 0.

Since it is guaranteed that an answer exists, this solution will create a valid result.
