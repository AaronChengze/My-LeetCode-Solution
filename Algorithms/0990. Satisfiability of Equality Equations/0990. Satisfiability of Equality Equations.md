# 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `equations` of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string `equations[i]` has length 4 and takes one of two different forms: `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`. Here, a and b are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["a==b","b!=a"]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second. There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["b==a","a==b"]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]

**Output:** true

**Example 4:**

**Input:** ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]

**Output:** false

**Example 5:**

**Input:** ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]

**Output:** true

**Note:**

1. `1 <= equations.length <= 500`
2. `equations[i].length == 4`
3. `equations[i][0]` and `equations[i][3]` are lowercase letters
4. `equations[i][1]` is either `'='` or `'!'`
5. equations[i][2]` is `'='`

## Solution
First loop over `equations` and only consider the equations that contain `"=="`. For each variable, expand the set of variables that has the same value as this variable. That is, for equation `"a==b"`, both `a` and `b` are added to the set of variables such that each variable in the set is equal to `a` and `b`. At the same time, if an equation is in the form `a!=a`, or equivalently the two variables are the same but are connected with `"!="`, then return `false`.

Then loop over `equations` and only consider the equations that contain `"!="`. If there exists an equation that contains `"!="` but the two variables are in the same set of equal variables, return `false`.

If no conflict is met, return `true`.
