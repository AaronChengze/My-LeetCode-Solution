# 992. Subarrays with K Different Integers
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array `A` of positive integers, call a (contiguous, not necessarily distinct) subarray of `A` *good* if the number of different integers in that subarray is exactly `K`.

(For example, `[1,2,3,1,2]` has `3` different integers: `1`, `2`, and `3`.)

Return the number of good subarrays of `A`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [1,2,1,2,3], K = 2

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:** Subarrays formed with exactly 2 different integers: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,1,2].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [1,2,1,3,4], K = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Subarrays formed with exactly 3 different integers: [1,2,1,3], [2,1,3], [1,3,4].

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= A.length`
3. `1 <= K <= A.length`

## Solution
Use sliding window. Maintain two pointers `left` and `right`, both of which are 0 initially. For each `right` from 0 to `A.length - 1`, count the number of subarrays that end at index `right` and are good subarrays. The method is as follows. Use a map to store each number and the number of occurrences of each number. Each time update the map with number at index `right`. If the map's size is greater than `K`, then move `left` one step to the right and update the map until the map's size is equal to `K`. Then for each `pointer` between `left` to `right` inclusive, check whether each subarray from `pointer` to `right` is a good subarray, and count the number of good subarrays accordingly.
