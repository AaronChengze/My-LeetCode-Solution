# 1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array `A` of integers, we **must** modify the array in the following way: we choose an `i` and replace `A[i]` with `-A[i]`, and we repeat this process `K` times in total. (We may choose the same index `i` multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [4,2,3], K = 1

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** Choose index (1) and A becomes [4,-2,3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [3,-1,0,2], K = 3

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and A becomes [3,1,0,2].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** A = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], K = 2

**Output:** 13

**Explanation:** Choose indices (1, 4) and A becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= K <= 10000`
3. `-100 <= A[i] <= 100`

## Solution
Sort the array. If there exist negative integers in the array, each time modify the negative integer with the greatest absolute value, which can maximize the sum, and reduce `K` by 1. If all the negative integers are modified, then since the same index may be chosen multiple times, it is possible to choose the same index twice to make the number unchanged, so only consider the case when the remaining `K` is odd, which means one more number needs to be modified. In the case when the remaining `K` is odd, find the number with the minimum value and modify it. Finally, calculate the sum of the modified array and return.
