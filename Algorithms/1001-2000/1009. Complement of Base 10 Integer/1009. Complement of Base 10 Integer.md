# 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer
## Level
Easy

## Description
Every non-negative integer `N` has a binary representation. For example, `5` can be represented as `"101"` in binary, `11` as `"1011"` in binary, and so on. Note that except for `N = 0`, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The *complement* of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every `1` to a `0` and `0` to a `1`. For example, the complement of `"101"` in binary is `"010"` in binary.

For a given number `N` in base-10, return the complement of its binary representation as a base-10 integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 7

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 10

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.

**Note:**

1. `0 <= N < 10^9`

## Solution
Since the complement of `0` is `1` and the complement of `1` is `0`, simply deal with these two numbers first.

For the other non-negative integers, consider the number of bits in binary representation, which can be calculated by using log<sub>2</sub>*N* + 1 for integer `N` (keep the integer part of the calculated result). For a number with `b` bits in binary representation, the sum of the number and its complement equals 2<sup>*b*</sup> - 1, so the complement equals 2<sup>*b*</sup> - 1 minus the given number.
