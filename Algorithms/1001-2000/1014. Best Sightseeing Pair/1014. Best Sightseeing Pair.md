# 1014. Best Sightseeing Pair
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `A` of positive integers, `A[i]` represents the value of the `i`-th sightseeing spot, and two sightseeing spots `i` and `j` have distance `j - i` between them.

The score of a pair (`i < j`) of sightseeing spots is (`A[i] + A[j] + i - j`): the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, **minus** the distance between them.

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [8,1,5,2,6]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:** i = 0, j = 2, A[i] + A[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11

**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 50000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 1000`

## Solution
For each index `i`, there are two scores, which are the left score `leftScore = A[i] + i` and the right score `rightScore = A[i] - i`. Initialize the maximum left score `maxLeftScore = A[0] + 0`. Then for `i` from 1 to `A.length - 1`, at each step calculate the left score `curLeftScore = A[i] + i` and the right score `curRightScore = A[i] - i`. Calculate the total score as `maxLeftScore + curRightScore` and update the maximum total score, and update the maximum left score as `maxLeftScore = Math.max(maxLeftScore, curLeftScore)`. Finally, return the maximum total score.
