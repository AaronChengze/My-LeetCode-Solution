# 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a positive integer `K`, you need find the **smallest** positive integer `N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`, and `N` only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of `N`. If there is no such `N`, return -1.

Example 1:

**Input:** 1

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 2

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.

**Note:**

* `1 <= K <= 10^5`

## Solution
If `K` is a multiple of 2 or 5, then any number divisible by `K` can't end with 1, so return `-1`.

Otherwise, each time append a 1 to the current number (which is initially 0) and check whether the new number is divisible by `K`. Use modulo operation to avoid overflow.
