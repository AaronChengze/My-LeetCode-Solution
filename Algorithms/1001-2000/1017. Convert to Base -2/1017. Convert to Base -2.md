# 1017. Convert to Base -2
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a number `N`, return a string consisting of `"0"`s and `"1"`s that represents its value in base **`-2`** (negative two).

The returned string must have no leading zeroes, unless the string is `"0"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 2

**Output:** "110"

**Explantion:** (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 3

**Output:** "111"

**Explantion:** (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 + (-2) ^ 0 = 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 4

**Output:** "100"

**Explantion:** (-2) ^ 2 = 4

**Note:**

1. `0 <= N <= 10^9`

## Solution
First convert `N` into its base 2 representation. To obtain the base -2 representation, consider the bits at odd indices that have value 1. Suppose the index is from right to left such that index `i` represents `(-2)^i`. Loop over the bits from the lowest bit to the highest bit. If an index `i` is odd and the bit at index `i` is 1, then increase the bit at index `i + 1` by 1, since `2^i == (-2)^(i + 1) + (-2)^i` when `i` is odd. If a bit at index `i` is greater than 1 (no matter whether `i` is odd or even), then decrease the bit at index `i` by 2 and increase the bit at index `i + 1` by 1 until the bit at index `i` is less than 2. Continue the process for all bits. Finally, return the base -2 representation.
