# 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal
## Level
Hard

## Description
We run a preorder depth first search on the `root` of a binary tree.

At each node in this traversal, we output `D` dashes (where `D` is the *depth* of this node), then we output the value of this node. *(If the depth of a node is `D`, the depth of its immediate child is `D+1`. The depth of the root node is 0.)*

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.

Given the output `S` of this traversal, recover the tree and return its `root`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"

**Output:** [1,2,5,3,4,6,7]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "1-2--3---4-5--6---7"

**Output:** [1,2,5,3,null,6,null,4,null,7]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "1-401--349---90--88"

**Output:** [1,401,null,349,88,90]

**Note:**

* The number of nodes in the original tree is between `1` and `1000`.
* Each node will have a value between `1` and `10^9`.

## Solution
First deal with string `S`. Split it into terms, each of which contains 0 or more dashes followed by a value. Use an array to store the terms, also in the order of preorder traversal.

Loop over the array from left to right. The first term is the root's value with no dashes before, so create the root node using the root's value. Use two stacks to store the nodes and the levels respectively. Push the root node into the node stack and push 0 into the level stack. For the other elements in the array, obtain the level and the value, create a node using the value, and find its parent as follows. While the element at the top of the level stack is greater than or equal to the current level, pop one element from each of the stacks. Then the element at the top of the node stack is the current node's parent. Assign the current node to the parent's left child if the parent does not have a left child, or assign the current node to the parent's right child otherwise.

Finally, return the root node.
