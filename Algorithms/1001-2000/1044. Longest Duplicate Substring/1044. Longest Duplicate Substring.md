# 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string `S`, consider all *duplicated substrings*: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times. (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return **any** duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. (If `S` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "banana"

**Output:** "ana"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "abcd"

**Output:** ""

**Note:**

1. `2 <= S.length <= 10^5`
2. `S` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use Rabin-Karp algorithm to find duplicate substrings. Obviously, if a duplicate substring of length `l` exists, then any duplicate substring that has length less than `l` also exists. First use binary search to find the maximum length of duplicated substring. Then find the longest duplicate substring.
