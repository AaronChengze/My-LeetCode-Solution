# 1060. Missing Element in Sorted Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a sorted array `A` of **unique** numbers, find the `K-th` missing number starting from the leftmost number of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [4,7,9,10], K = 1

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

The first missing number is 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [4,7,9,10], K = 3

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

The missing numbers are [5,6,8,...], hence the third missing number is 8.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** A = [1,2,4], K = 3

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

The missing numbers are [3,5,6,7,...], hence the third missing number is 6.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 50000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 1e7`
3. `1 <= K <= 1e8`

## Solution
If the array `nums` is empty, simply return `k` since all numbers are missing in `nums`.

If `k` is greater than or equal to the last number in `nums`, then only the numbers in `nums` are not missing and all the other numbers are missing, so the k-th missing number is `k + nums[0] + nums.length - 1`.

Otherwise, starting from the first letter in `nums`, check each number that is greater, and if a number is not in the array, then it is missing and decrease `k` by 1. The process ends until the end of `nums` is reached or `k` becomes 0. Finally, return the current number plus `k`.
