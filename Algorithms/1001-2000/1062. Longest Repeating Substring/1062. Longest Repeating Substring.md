# 1062. Longest Repeating Substring
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string `S`, find out the length of the longest repeating substring(s). Return `0` if no repeating substring exists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "abcd"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no repeating substring.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "abbaba"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The longest repeating substrings are "ab" and "ba", each of which occurs twice.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "aabcaabdaab"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest repeating substring is "aab", which occurs 3 times.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** "aaaaa"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The longest repeating substring is "aaaa", which occurs twice.

**Note:**

1. The string `S` consists of only lowercase English letters from `'a'` - `'z'`.
2. `1 <= S.length <= 1500`

## Solution
Use a trie to find repeating substrings. Starting from each index in `S`, create a trie. If a node in a trie already exists when trying to create the node, then the node represents a repeating substring, so update the maximum length of the repeating substrings. Finally, return the maximum length.
