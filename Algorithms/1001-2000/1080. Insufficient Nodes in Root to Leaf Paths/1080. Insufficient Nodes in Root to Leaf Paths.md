# 1080. Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, consider all *root to leaf paths*: paths from the root to any leaf. (A leaf is a node with no children.)

A `node` is *insufficient* if **every** such root to leaf path intersecting this node has sum strictly less than `limit`.

Delete all insufficient nodes simultaneously, and return the root of the resulting binary tree.

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,-99,-99,7,8,9,-99,-99,12,13,-99,14], limit = 1

**Output:** [1,2,3,4,null,null,7,8,9,null,14]

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,1,null,null,5,3], limit = 22

Output: [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,null,null,null,5]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,-3,-5,null,4,null], limit = -1

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/11/screen-shot-2019-06-11-at-83517-pm.png)

**Output:** [1,null,-3,4]

**Note:**

1. The given tree will have between `1` and `5000` nodes.
2. `-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5`
3. `-10^9 <= limit <= 10^9`

## Solution
Use depth first search. For each node with the accumulated sum, determine whether it should be remained. If the node is a leaf, then calculate the sum of the accumulated sum and the node's value, and the node should be remained if and only if the new sum is greater than or equal to `limit`. For other nodes, check whether its children should be remained. If at least one child is remained, the node is also remained. Otherwise, the node is deleted.
