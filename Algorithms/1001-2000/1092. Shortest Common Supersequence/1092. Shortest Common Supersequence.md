# 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

*(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"

**Output:** "cabac"

**Explanation:**

str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".

str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".

The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
2. `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
First, use dynamic programming to obtain the length of the longest common subsequence of `str1` and `str2`. Then loop over `str1` and `str2` in reversing order to obtain the shortest common supersequence. If the two characters in `str1` and `str2` are the same, then append it to the supersequence, decrease the length of the longest common subsequence by 1 and decrease both indices by 1. Otherwise, choose the indices pair that has length equal to the length of the longest common subsequence and decrease the corresponding index by 1. Finally, reverse the supersequence and return.
