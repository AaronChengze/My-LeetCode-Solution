# 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/01/screen-shot-2019-07-01-at-53836-pm.png)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]

**Output:** [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.
* Each node has a distinct value between `1` and `1000`.
* `to_delete.length <= 1000`
* `to_delete` contains distinct values between `1` and `1000`.

## Solution
Use breadth first search and obtain each node's parent. Then loop over all nodes in reversing order. If a node to be deleted is met, then update its parent's children information so that the parent's corresponding child becomes `null`, and the node's non-null children become roots of new trees, so add the new roots to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
