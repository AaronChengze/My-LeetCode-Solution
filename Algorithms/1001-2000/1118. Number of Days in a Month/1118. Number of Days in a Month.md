# 1118. Number of Days in a Month
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a year `Y` and a month `M`, return how many days there are in that month.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** Y = 1992, M = 7

**Output:** 31

**Example 2:**

**Input:** Y = 2000, M = 2

**Output:** 29

**Example 3:**

**Input:** Y = 1900, M = 2

**Output:** 28

**Note:**

1. `1583 <= Y <= 2100`
2. `1 <= M <= 12`

## Solution
If `M` is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, then there are 31 days in that month.

If `M` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, then there are 30 days in that month.

If `M` is 2, then `Y` needs to be checked whether it is a leap year. If `Y` is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or `Y` is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year. There are 29 days in that month if it is a leap year or 28 days in that month otherwise.
