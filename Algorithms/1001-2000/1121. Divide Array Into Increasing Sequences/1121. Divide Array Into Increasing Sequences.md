# 1121. Divide Array Into Increasing Sequences
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a **non-decreasing** array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `K`, find out if this array can be divided into one or more **disjoint increasing subsequences of length at least** `K`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2,3,3,4,4], K = 3

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The array can be divided into the two subsequences [1,2,3,4] and [2,3,4] with lengths at least 3 each.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,6,6,7,8], K = 3

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

There is no way to divide the array using the conditions required.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
2. `1 <= K <= nums.length`
3. `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution
In each increasing subsequence, there are no duplicates. Therefore, if a number occurs more than once, then each occurrence of the number must be in a different increasing subsequence. Since the array is non-decreasing, all elements that are equal are adjacent to each other, the number of occurrences of each element can be counted easily by looping over the array once.

If the maximum occurrence of an element is `m`, which means the element that occurs most in the array appears for `m` times, then there are at least `m` increasing subsequences. If `m * K > nums.length`, then it is impossible to divide the array into several disjoint increasing subsequences of length at least `K`, so return `false`. If `m * K <= nums.length`, then it is always possible to divide the array into several disjoint increasing subsequences of length at least `K`, so return `true`.
