# 1122. Relative Sort Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that don't appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]

**Output:** [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]

**Constraints:**

* `arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
* Each `arr2[i]` is distinct.
* Each `arr2[i]` is in `arr1`.

## Solution
First, obtain the order according to `arr2`. For each number in `arr2`, use a `Map` to store the number and its corresponding index, and the index represents the order.

Next, do insertion sort for `arr1`. For each number in `arr1`, compare its order with its previous numbers. If the current number is in `arr2`, then find the insertion point using the order. Otherwise, find the insertion point using the number itself. The numbers not in `arr2` must be after the numbers in `arr2`.
