# 1131. Maximum of Absolute Value Expression
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two arrays of integers with equal lengths, return the maximum value of:

`|arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j|`

where the maximum is taken over all `0 <= i, j < arr1.length`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr1 = [1,2,3,4], arr2 = [-1,4,5,6]

**Output:** 13

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr1 = [1,-2,-5,0,10], arr2 = [0,-2,-1,-7,-4]

**Output:** 20

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= arr1.length == arr2.length <= 40000`
* `-10^6 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^6`

## Solution
For the expression `|arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j|`, there are 4 cases as follows.
1. `arr1[i] - arr1[j] >= 0` and `arr2[i] - arr2[j] >= 0`. The expression is equivalent to `(arr1[i] + arr2[i]) - (arr1[j] + arr2[j]) + |i - j|`.
2. `arr1[i] - arr1[j] >= 0` and `arr2[i] - arr2[j] < 0`. The expression is equivalent to `(arr1[i] - arr2[i]) - (arr1[j] - arr2[j]) + |i - j|`.
3. `arr1[i] - arr1[j] < 0` and `arr2[i] - arr2[j] >= 0`. The expression is equivalent to `(-arr1[i] + arr2[i]) - (-arr1[j] + arr2[j]) + |i - j|`.
4. `arr1[i] - arr1[j] < 0` and `arr2[i] - arr2[j] < 0`. The expression is equivalent to `(-arr1[i] - arr2[i]) - (-arr1[j] - arr2[j]) + |i - j|`.

Each case can be represented in the form `arr[i] - arr[j] + |i - j|`. In the form, either `i >= j` or `i < j`.

So loop over all possible cases and find the maximum value.
