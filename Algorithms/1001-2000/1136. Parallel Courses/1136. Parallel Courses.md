# 1136. Parallel Courses
## Level
Hard

## Description
There are `N` courses, labelled from 1 to `N`.

We are given `relations[i] = [X, Y]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `X` and course `Y`: course `X` has to be studied before course `Y`.

In one semester you can study any number of courses as long as you have studied all the prerequisites for the course you are studying.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to study all courses. If there is no way to study all the courses, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

In the first semester, courses 1 and 2 are studied. In the second semester, course 3 is studied.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

No course can be studied because they depend on each other.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= N <= 5000`
2. `1 <= relations.length <= 5000`
3. `relations[i][0] != relations[i][1]`
4. There are no repeated relations in the input.

## Solution
Use topological sort. Use a map to store each course and the courses that have such a course as a prerequisite. Also use an array `indegrees` to store the indegrees of each course. For each `relation` in `relations`, if `relation = [X, Y]`, then add `Y - 1` to the list of `X - 1` in the map, and increase `indegrees[Y - 1]` by 1. (Note that the courses' labels are 1-indexed but the array is 0-indexed.)

Initialize the number of remaining courses to `N` (remaining means the indegree is not 0). Do breadth first search. For each course that has indegree 0, decrease the number of remaining courses by 1, and offer the course into the queue. Initialize the number of semesters as 0.

While the queue is not empty, in each iteration, increase the number of semesters by 1, poll each element from the queue (only consider the elements before offering any new element into the queue), and for each element, get the next courses from the map, and decrease each next course's indegree by 1. If a next course's indegree becomes 0, then decrease the number of remaining courses by 1, and offer the next course into the queue.

Finally, if the number of remaining courses is greater than 0, return -1. Otherwise, return the number of semesters.
