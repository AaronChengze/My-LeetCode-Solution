# 1153. String Transforms Into Another String
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given two strings `str1` and `str2` of the same length, determine whether you can transform `str1` into `str2` by doing **zero or more** *conversions*.

In one conversion you can convert **all** occurrences of one character in `str1` to **any** other lowercase English character.

Return `true` if and only if you can transform `str1` into `str2`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** str1 = "aabcc", str2 = "ccdee"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Convert 'c' to 'e' then 'b' to 'd' then 'a' to 'c'. Note that the order of conversions matter.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** str1 = "leetcode", str2 = "codeleet"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** There is no way to transform str1 to str2.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= str1.length == str2.length <= 10^4`
2. Both `str1` and `str2` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
First consider some base cases. If either `str1` or `str2` is `null`, return `false`. If `str1` and `str2` are the same, return `true`. Otherwise, if all lowercase letters occur in `str2`, return `false` since conversions will definitely cause duplicates in `str1` and make it impossible to transform `str1` into `str2`.

Then loop over `str1` and for each letter, store the indices in `str1`. If there exists two indices such that the letters at the two indices in `str1` are the same but the letters at the two indices in `str2` are different, return `false` since it is impossible to convert two same letters into two different letters. If no such indices exist, return `true`.
