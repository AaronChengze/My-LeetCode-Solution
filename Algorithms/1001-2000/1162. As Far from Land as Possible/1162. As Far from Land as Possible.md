# 1162. As Far from Land as Possible
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an N x N `grid` containing only values `0` and `1`, where `0` represents water and `1` represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.

The distance used in this problem is the *Manhattan distance*: the distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and (x1, y1) is `|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.

If no land or water exists in the grid, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100`
2. `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Loop over `grid` and put all the cells that have value 1 to the queue. After all cells in `grid` are visited, if the queue is empty or the queue's size equals the size of `grid`, then no land or water exists in the grid, so return -1.

Starting from the cells in the queue. For each cell, check the four directions and obtain all adjacent cells. If an adjacent cell has not been visited, then update the adjacent cell's distance, and offer the adjacent cell to the queue for the next step's search. Finally, return the maximum distance.
