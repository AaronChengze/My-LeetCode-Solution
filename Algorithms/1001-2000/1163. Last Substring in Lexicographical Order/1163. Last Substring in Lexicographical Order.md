# 1163. Last Substring in Lexicographical Order
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string `s`, return the last substring of `s` in lexicographical order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "abab"

**Output:** "bab"

**Explanation:** The substrings are ["a", "ab", "aba", "abab", "b", "ba", "bab"]. The lexicographically maximum substring is "bab".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "leetcode"

**Output:** "tcode"

**Note:**

1. `1 <= s.length <= 4 * 10^5`
2. `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
The last substring of `s` must start with the maximum letter in `s`. Loop over `s` in reversing order and maintain the maximum letter. If the current letter is greater than the maximum letter, then update the maximum letter with the current letter. If the current letter equals the maximum letter, then if the letter before the current letter is the same as the current letter, continue. Otherwise, compare the current substring with the substring starting from the previous maximum letter. If the current substring is greater, then update the last substring to be starting from the current position. Finally, return the last substring.
