# 1172. Dinner Plate Stacks
## Level
Hard

## Description
You have an infinite number of stacks arranged in a row and numbered (left to right) from 0, each of the stacks has the same maximum `capacity`.

Implement the `DinnerPlates` class:

* `DinnerPlates(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the maximum capacity of the stacks.
* `void push(int val)` pushes the given positive integer val into the leftmost stack with size less than capacity.
* `int pop()` returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack, and returns `-1` if all stacks are empty.
* `int popAtStack(int index)` returns the value at the top of the stack with the given `index` and removes it from that stack, and returns `-1` if the stack with that given `index` is empty.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
["DinnerPlates","push","push","push","push","push","popAtStack","push","push","popAtStack","popAtStack","pop","pop","pop","pop","pop"]
[[2],[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[0],[20],[21],[0],[2],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,null,null,null,null,null,2,null,null,20,21,5,4,3,1,-1]

Explanation: 
DinnerPlates D = DinnerPlates(2);  // Initialize with capacity = 2
D.push(1);
D.push(2);
D.push(3);
D.push(4);
D.push(5);         // The stacks are now:  2  4
                                           1  3  5

D.popAtStack(0);   // Returns 2.  The stacks are now:     4
                                                       1  3  5

D.push(20);        // The stacks are now: 20  4
                                           1  3  5
                                           ﹈ ﹈ ﹈
D.push(21);        // The stacks are now: 20  4 21
                                           1  3  5
                                           ﹈ ﹈ ﹈
D.popAtStack(0);   // Returns 20.  The stacks are now:     4 21
                                                        1  3  5
                                                        ﹈ ﹈ ﹈
D.popAtStack(2);   // Returns 21.  The stacks are now:     4
                                                        1  3  5
                                                        ﹈ ﹈ ﹈ 
D.pop()            // Returns 5.  The stacks are now:      4
                                                        1  3 
                                                        ﹈ ﹈  
D.pop()            // Returns 4.  The stacks are now:   1  3 
                                                        ﹈ ﹈   
D.pop()            // Returns 3.  The stacks are now:   1 
                                                        ﹈   
D.pop()            // Returns 1.  There are no stacks.
D.pop()            // Returns -1.  There are still no stacks.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= capacity <= 20000`
* `1 <= val <= 20000`
* `0 <= index <= 100000`
* At most `200000` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, and `popAtStack`.

## Solution
In the class, maintain `capacity` that is the capacity of each stack, a tree map that stores each index and the corresponding stack, a tree set that stores the indices of available stacks, and the current stack's index.

For the constructor, initialize the fields, where the current stack's index is initialized to 0.

For method `push`, check whether there is any element in the tree set. If so, obtain the minimum index from the tree set and the corresponding stack and add the element `val` to the stack, and remove the minimum index from the tree set if the stack becomes full. Otherwise, add the element `val` to the stack at the current stack's index, and increase the current stack's index by 1 if the stack becomes full.

For method `pop`, if the tree map does not have any entry, return -1. Otherwise, obtain the maximum index in the tree map and obtain the corresponding stack, and pop one element from the stack. Update the current stack's index if the last stack is not full. Finally, return the popped element.

For method `popAtIndex`, first obtain the stack at the given index. If the stack is empty, return -1. Otherwise, pop one element from the stack, and update the current stack's index if necessary or add the given index to the tree set if the given index is not equal to or adjacent to the current stack's index. Finally, return the popped element.
