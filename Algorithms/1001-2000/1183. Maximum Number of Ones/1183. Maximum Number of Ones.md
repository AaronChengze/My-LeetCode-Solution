# 1183. Maximum Number of Ones
## Level
Hard

## Description
Consider a matrix `M` with dimensions `width * height`, such that every cell has value `0` or `1`, and any **square** sub-matrix of `M` of size `sideLength * sideLength` has at most `maxOnes` ones.

Return the maximum possible number of ones that the matrix `M` can have.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: width = 3, height = 3, sideLength = 2, maxOnes = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
In a 3*3 matrix, no 2*2 sub-matrix can have more than 1 one.
The best solution that has 4 ones is:
[1,0,1]
[0,0,0]
[1,0,1]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: width = 3, height = 3, sideLength = 2, maxOnes = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:
[1,0,1]
[1,0,1]
[1,0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= width, height <= 100`
* `1 <= sideLength <= width, height`
* `0 <= maxOnes <= sideLength * sideLength`

## Solution
Starting from cell `(0, 0)`, consider each square sub-matrix of size `sideLength * sideLength`. Use a 2D array `counts` to store the counts of each position of the square sub-matrix. For each `i` from 0 to `height - 1` and for each `j` from 0 to `width - 1`, increase `counts[i % sideLength][j % sideLength]` by 1. Then use a priority queue to store all the elements in `counts`, where the maximum element is polled first. Poll `maxOnes` elements from the priority queue and calculate their sum, and return.
