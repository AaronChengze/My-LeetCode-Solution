# 1203. Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies
## Level
Hard

## Description
There are `n` items each belonging to zero or one of `m` groups where `group[i]` is the group that the `i`-th item belongs to and it's equal to `-1` if the `i`-th item belongs to no group. The items and the groups are zero indexed. A group can have no item belonging to it.

Return a sorted list of the items such that:

* The items that belong to the same group are next to each other in the sorted list.
* There are some relations between these items where `beforeItems[i]` is a list containing all the items that should come before the `i`-th item in the sorted array (to the left of the `i`-th item).

Return any solution if there is more than one solution and return an **empty list** if there is no solution.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/11/1359_ex1.png)

**Input:** n = 8, m = 2, group = [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], beforeItems = [[],[6],[5],[6],[3,6],[],[],[]]

**Output:** [6,3,4,1,5,2,0,7]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 8, m = 2, group = [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1], beforeItems = [[],[6],[5],[6],[3],[],[4],[]]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:** This is the same as example 1 except that 4 needs to be before 6 in the sorted list.

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= m <= n <= 3*10^4
* group.length == beforeItems.length == n
* -1 <= group[i] <= m-1
* 0 <= beforeItems[i].length <= n-1
* 0 <= beforeItems[i][j] <= n-1
* i != beforeItems[i][j]
* `beforeItems[i]` does not contain duplicates elements.

## Solution
First, for each item that does not belong to any group, assign a group to the item starting from group `m`. It is guaranteed that among all the items that do not belong to any group, any two items will belong to different groups after assigning groups to such items.

Next, do topological sort for two times.

The first time is to find the relative order among all the groups. Calculate each group's indegree. If item `a` is before item `b`, then increase item `b`'s group's indegree by 1 if and only if item `a` and item `b` belong to different groups. Then do breadth first search starting from the groups with indegree 0. Each time a group is visited, decrease the group's indegree by 1. If a group's indegree becomes 0, then the group will be searched next. After the first topological sort, if all groups are sorted, which means there is no cycle, then continue to the second topological sort. Otherwise, the order among the groups is invalid, so return an empty array.

The second time is to find the relative order among all the items. Calculate each item's indegree. If item `a` is before item `b`, then increase item `b`'s indegree by 1. Then visit each group in the group order. For each group, do breadth first search starting from the items with indegree 0. Each time an item is visited, decrease the item's indegree by 1, no matter whether the item is in the current group or not. If an item's indegree becomes 0 and the item is in the current group, then the item will be searched next. After the second topological sort, if all items are sorted, which means there is no cycle, then return the ordered array. Otherwise, the order among the items is invalid, so return an empty array.
