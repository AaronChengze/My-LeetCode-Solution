# 1206. Design Skiplist
## Level
Hard

## Description
Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

*A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to `add`, `erase` and `search`. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.*

*For example: we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:*

*You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, `add`, `erase` and `search` can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).*

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

* `bool search(int target)`: Return whether the `target` exists in the Skiplist or not.
* `void add(int num)`: Insert a value into the SkipList. 
* `bool erase(int num)`: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.

See more about Skiplist: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list)

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

**Example:**
```
Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();

skiplist.add(1);
skiplist.add(2);
skiplist.add(3);
skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
skiplist.add(4);
skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= num, target <= 20000`
* At most `50000` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.

## Solution
Create a class `Node` that contains `val`, `prev`, `next` and `down`, which correspond to the node's value, its previous node in the same level, its next node in the same level, and the node with the same value in the lower level.

In the class `Skiplist`, maintain a list `heads` that stores each level's header.

For the constructor, initialize `heads` and add a new node with value -1 into `heads`.

For method `search`, search from the highest level. At each level, if `target` is found, return `true`. Otherwise, move to the next node if the next node's value is less than `target`, or go to the lower level if the next node does not exist or the next node's value is greater than `target`. If `target` is not found, return `false`.

For method `add`, first find the corresponding node in each level (the node that has value `num` or if no node with value `num` exists, the rightmost node that has value less than `num`), and then insert the new node with value `num` at the correct position in the lowest level. Then do coin flip. If the coin flip result is `true`, then find the position of insertion in the higher level and do insertion, or create a new level and insert the node just after the header of the level. Otherwise, stop processing further.

For method `erase`, first find the corresponding node in each level, as in method `add`, and then for each level, delete the corresponding node if the node's value equals `num`. Return `true` if and only if at least one node is deleted.
