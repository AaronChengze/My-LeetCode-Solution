## Description
Given two binary search trees, return `True` if and only if there is a node in the first tree and a node in the second tree whose values sum up to a given integer `target`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3], target = 5

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** 2 and 3 sum up to 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root1 = [0,-10,10], root2 = [5,1,7,0,2], target = 18

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* Each tree has at most `5000` nodes.
* `-10^9 <= target, node.val <= 10^9`

## Solution
Since the inorder traversal of a binary search tree contains all the elements in ascending order, the idea of inorder traversal can be used to solve this problem. Use the idea of the solution to problem 94.

For the two binary search trees, do inorder traversal on the first binary search tree such that the left subtree is visited before the right subtree, and do inorder traversal on the second binary search tree such that the right subtree is visited before the left subtree. In this way, the elements in the first binary search tree are visited in ascending order, and the elements in the second binary search tree are visited in descending order.

Maintain two stacks for the two binary search trees respectively. For the first binary search tree, push all the nodes from the root to the leftmost node into the first stack, and each time pop an element from the first stack, which is the element visited currently, and move to its right child and repeat the process. For the second binary search tree, push all the nodes from the root to the rightmost node into the second stack, and each time pop an element from the second stack, which is the element visited currently, and move to its left child and repeat the process.

The idea is described above. Each time peek the top elements from both stack and calculate their values' sum. If the sum is equal to `target`, return `true`. If the sum is less than `target`, then move to the next (greater) element in the first binary search tree. If the sum is greater than `target`, then move to the next (smaller) element in the second binary search tree. If no such nodes are found, return `false`.
