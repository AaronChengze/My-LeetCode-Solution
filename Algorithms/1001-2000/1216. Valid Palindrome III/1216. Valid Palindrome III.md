# 1216. Valid Palindrome III
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find out if the given string is a *K-Palindrome* or not.

A string is K-Palindrome if it can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most `k` characters from it.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcdeca", k = 2

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Remove 'b' and 'e' characters.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` has only lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= k <= s.length`

## Solution
This problem can be solved by first obtaining the length of the longest palindromic subsequence, and check whether the difference between the string's length and the length of the longest palindromic subsequence is less than or equal to `k`.

To obtain the length of the longest palindromic subsequence, use the solution to problem 516.
