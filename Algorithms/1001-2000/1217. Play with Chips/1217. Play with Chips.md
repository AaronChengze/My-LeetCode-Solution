# 1217. Play with Chips
## Level
Easy

## Description
There are some chips, and the i-th chip is at position `chips[i]`.

You can perform any of the two following types of moves **any number of times** (possibly zero) **on any chip**:

*  Move the `i`-th chip by 2 units to the left or to the right with a cost of **0**.
* Move the `i`-th chip by 1 unit to the left or to the right with a cost of **1**.

There can be two or more chips at the same position initially.

Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position (any position).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** chips = [1,2,3]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Second chip will be moved to positon 3 with cost 1. First chip will be moved to position 3 with cost 0. Total cost is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** chips = [2,2,2,3,3]
**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Both fourth and fifth chip will be moved to position two with cost 1. Total minimum cost will be 2.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= chips.length <= 100`
* `1 <= chips[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution
Any chip at an even position can move to any other even position with a cost of 0. Any chip at an odd position can move to any other odd positoin with a cost of 0. To move all the chips to the same position, first move all the chips at even positions to the same even position, and move all the chips at odd positions to the same odd position. Then either move the chips at the even position to the odd position, or move the chips at the odd position to the even position. The minimum cost is the minimum between the number of chips at the even position and the number of chips at the odd position.
