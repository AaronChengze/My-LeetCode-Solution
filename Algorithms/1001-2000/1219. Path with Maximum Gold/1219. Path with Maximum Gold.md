# 1219. Path with Maximum Gold
## Level
Medium

## Description
In a gold mine `grid` of size `m * n`, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, `0` if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

* Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
* From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
* You can't visit the same cell more than once.
* Never visit a cell with `0` gold.
* You can start and stop collecting gold from **any** position in the grid that has some gold.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 15`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
* There are at most **25** cells containing gold.

## Solution
Use bracktrack. Starting from any cell in `grid` that is not 0, do depth first search. Each time visit each of the four directions. If in one direction there is no cell or the cell is 0 or the cell has already been visited, then update the maximum gold. Finally, return the maximum gold.
