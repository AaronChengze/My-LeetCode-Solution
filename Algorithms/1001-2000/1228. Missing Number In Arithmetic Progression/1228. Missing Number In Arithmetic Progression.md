# 1228. Missing Number In Arithmetic Progression
## Level
Easy

## Description
In some array `arr`, the values were in arithmetic progression: the values `arr[i+1] - arr[i]` are all equal for every `0 <= i < arr.length - 1`.

Then, a value from `arr` was removed that **was not the first or last value in the array**.

Return the removed value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [5,7,11,13]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** The previous array was [5,7,9,11,13].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [15,13,12]

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:** The previous array was [15,14,13,12].

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution
For the original arithmetic progression (no value removed), all pairs of adjacent numbers in the array have the same difference.

After a value is removed, then one pair of adjacent numbers in the array will have a difference that has a greater absolute value.

If a difference with a greater absolute value is found, then find the two numbers with such the difference with a greater absolute value, and the removed value is the average value of the two numbers.
