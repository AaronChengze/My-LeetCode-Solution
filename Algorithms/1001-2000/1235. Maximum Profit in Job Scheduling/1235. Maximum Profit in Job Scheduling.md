# 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling
## Level
Hard

## Description
We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i] `to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, you need to output the maximum profit you can take such that there are no 2 jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]

**Output:** 120

**Explanation:** The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]

**Output:** 150

**Explanation:** The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]

**Output:** 6

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution
Create a 2D array `jobs` such that each row in `jobs` contains a job's start time, end time and profit. Then sort `jobs` according to the jobs' end time.

After sorting, for each job, find the maximum possible index of the previous job, and if no previous job is available, use -1 to represent the previous job.

Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `n` rows and 2 columns, where `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` represent the maximum profit for the first `i + 1` jobs when the last job is not done or is done, respectively. Initially, `dp[0][0] = 0` and `dp[0][1] = jobs[0][2]`.

For `i` from 1 to `n - 1`, `dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1])`. For `dp[i][1]`, let `prevJob` represent the maximum possible index of previous job, and `dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[prevJob][0], dp[prevJob][1]) + jobs[i][2]` if `prevJob >= 0` or `dp[i][1] = jobs[i][2]` if `prevJob < 0`.

Finally, return the maximum of `dp[length - 1][0]` and `dp[length - 1][1]`.
