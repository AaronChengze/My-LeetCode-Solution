# 1240. Tiling a Rectangle with the Fewest Squares
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a rectangle of size `n` x `m`, find the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the rectangle.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** 3 squares are necessary to cover the rectangle.

2 (squares of 1x1)

1 (square of 2x2)

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, m = 8

**Output:** 5

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 11, m = 13

**Output:** 6

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 13`
* `1 <= m <= 13`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `n + 1` rows and `m + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the `i * j` rectangle.

Obviously, if `i == j`, `dp[i][j] = 1`. Otherwise, the rectangle can be split by a horizontal line or a vertical line, which leads to two smaller rectangles, or a square may be put in the middle. For each case, calculate the minimum number of squares needed.

Finally, return `dp[n][m]`.
