# 1254. Number of Closed Islands
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water).  An *island* is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s` and a *closed island* is an island **totally** (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s`.

Return the number of *closed islands*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
```
**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/31/sample_4_1610.png)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <=1`

## Solution
Use breadth first search. First do breadth first search on all the cells on the border that are zeros and mark them as visited. Then do breadth first search on all the cells inside that are zeros. For each cell inside that is zero, visited all the connected zeros and mark them as visited, and increase the number of closed islands by 1. Finally, return the number of closed islands.
