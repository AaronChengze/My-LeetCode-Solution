# 1257. Smallest Common Region
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given some lists of `regions` where the first region of each list includes all other regions in that list.

Naturally, if a region `X` contains another region `Y` then `X` is bigger than `Y`. Also by definition a region X contains itself.

Given two regions `region1`, `region2`, find out the **smallest** region that contains both of them.

If you are given regions `r1`, `r2` and `r3` such that `r1` includes `r3`, it is guaranteed there is no `r2` such that `r2` includes `r3`.

It's guaranteed the smallest region exists.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
regions = [["Earth","North America","South America"],
["North America","United States","Canada"],
["United States","New York","Boston"],
["Canada","Ontario","Quebec"],
["South America","Brazil"]],
region1 = "Quebec",
region2 = "New York"
Output: "North America"
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= regions.length <= 10^4`
* `region1 != region2`
* All strings consist of English letters and spaces with at most 20 letters.

## Solution
Use a map to store each region and its parent. Say region X is region Y's parent if region X directly includes region Y. Also say region X is region Z's ancestor if there exists a path such that X -> X<sub>1</sub> -> X<sub>2</sub> -> ... -> X<sub>n</sub> -> X<sub>n+1</sub> -> ... -> Z where "->" represents a parent-child relation (that is to say, X<sub>n</sub> is a parent of X<sub>n+1</sub>).

Use a set to store `region1` and all its ancestors. Then for `region2`, find the lowest ancestor that is in the set, which is the lowest ancestor of `region1`. Return the lowest ancestor.
