# 1263. Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location
## Level
Hard

## Description
Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.

The game is represented by a `grid` of size `m x n`, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.

Your task is move the box `'B'` to the target position `'T'` under the following rules:

* Player is represented by character `'S'` and can move up, down, left, right in the grid if it is a floor (empy cell).
* Floor is represented by character `'.'` that means free cell to walk.
* Wall is represented by character `'#'` that means obstacle (impossible to walk there). 
* There is only one box `'B'` and one target cell `'T'` in the grid.
* The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a **push**.
* The player cannot walk through the box.

Return the minimum number of **pushes** to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We return only the number of times the box is pushed.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: -1
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T",".",".","#","#"],
               ["#",".","#","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: 5
Explanation:  push the box down, left, left, up and up.
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","S","#",".","B","T","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m <= 20`
* `1 <= n <= 20`
* `grid` contains only characters `'.'`, `'#'`, `'S'` , `'T'`, or `'B'`.
* There is only one character `'S'`, `'B'` and `'T'` in the `grid`.

## Solution
To find the minimum moves, breadth first search may be considered first. However, in this problem, there are two objects, the box and the player, and the distance is only relevant to the box, so using breadth first search directly doesn't work. If using breadth first search directly, one possible error is that when the box is pushed in one direction, the move that is considered first is to push the box further in the same direction, rather than pushing the box in another correct direction. In this way, the search is similar to depth first search and the path is not guaranteed to be the shortest.

To obtain the correct answer, use priority queue. Each element in the priority queue is a status that consists of five properties, which are the row and the column of the box, the row and the column of the player, and the number of times that the box is pushed. The status where the number of times that the box is pushed is the least is polled from the priority queue first. By using the priority queue, the number of moves is guaranteed to be the minimum.
