# 1271. Hexspeak
## Level
Easy

## Description
A decimal number can be converted to its *Hexspeak* representation by first converting it to an uppercase hexadecimal string, then replacing all occurrences of the digit `0` with the letter `O`, and the digit `1` with the letter `I`. Such a representation is *valid* if and only if it consists only of the letters in the set `{"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "I", "O"}`.

Given a string `num` representing a decimal integer `N`, return the Hexspeak representation of `N` if it is valid, otherwise return `"ERROR"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "257"

**Output:** "IOI"

**Explanation:**  257 is 101 in hexadecimal.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = "3"

**Output:** "ERROR"

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= N <= 10^12
* There are no leading zeros in the given string.
* All answers must be in uppercase letters.

## Solution
The solution is quite straightforward. Convert the decimal number to the hexadecimal string, change the string to uppercase, and replace `0` with `O` and `1` with `I`. Then check each character in the string. If a character out of the set `{"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "I", "O"}` occurs, return `"ERROR"`. If the string is valid, return the string.
