# 1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To
## Level
Medium

## Description
There are `n` people whose **IDs** go from `0` to `n - 1` and each person belongs **exactly** to one group. Given the array `groupSizes` of length `n` telling the group size each person belongs to, return the groups there are and the people's **IDs** each group includes.

You can return any solution in any order and the same applies for IDs. Also, it is guaranteed that there exists at least one solution. 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]

**Output:** [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]

**Explanation:**

Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]

**Output:** [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]

**Constraints:**

* `groupSizes.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 500`
* `1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n`

## Solution
First, for each group size, get the people who belongs to a group of such a size. Use a `Map` to do this.

Next, for a group size `groupSize`, get the list `people` that contains the IDs of the people who belong to a group of such a size. If the size of `people` equals `groupSize`, then these people are in the same group. If the size of `people` is greater than `groupSize`, then the people should be split into several groups, each of which has size `groupSize`.
