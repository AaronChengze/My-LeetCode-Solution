# 1287. Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer array **sorted** in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that occurs more than 25% of the time.

Return that integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]

**Output:** 6

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
* `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution
There are several ways to solve this problem. Only one solution is described here, which is not guaranteed to be the optimal solution.

Use a `Map` to store the counts of each numbers in the array. If a number's count is more than 25% of the array's length (which can be represented by `count * 4 > length`), return the number.
