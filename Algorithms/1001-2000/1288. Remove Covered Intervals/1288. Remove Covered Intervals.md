# 1288. Remove Covered Intervals
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. Interval `[a,b)` is covered by interval `[c,d)` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= intervals.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^5`
* `intervals[i] != intervals[j] for all i != j`

## Solution
First, sort the intervals according to the begin points and the end points. That is, interval `[a,b)` is sorted before interval `[c,d)` if and only if `a < c` or `a == c` and `b < d`.

Next, for each interval, check all the intervals behind it to see whether each interval behind it is covered by it. If so, mark the covered interval as to be removed. If an interval is completely behind the current interval (the next interval's begin points is after the current interval's end point), then break the current interval's loop and go on to the next interval.

Finally, return the number of intervals to be removed.
