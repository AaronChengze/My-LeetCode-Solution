# 1304. Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return *any* array containing `n` *unique* integers such that they add up to 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** [-7,-1,1,3,4]

**Explanation:** These arrays also are accepted [-5,-1,1,2,3] , [-3,-1,2,-2,4].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** [-1,0,1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** [0]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 1000`

## Solution
There are several ways to solve this problem.

First consider the case where `n` equals 1. In this case, just return an array with length 1 and the element in the array is 0.

For `n` larger than 1, consider whether `n` is even or odd.

If `n` is even, just choose several pairs of opposite numbers according to the indices (two numbers `a` and `b` are opposite numbers of each other if `a + b = 0`). For odd indices, the element at the index equals the index. For even indices, the element at the index equals the opposite of its next element. An example is [-1, 1, -3, 3, -5, 5].

If `n` is odd, let the element at index 0 be 0, and choose several pairs of opposite numbers for the rest of the indices according to the indices. For odd indices, the element at the index equals the index. For even indices, the element at the index equals the opposite of its previous element. An example is [0, 1, -1, 3, -3, 5, -5].
