# 1306. Jump Game III
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of non-negative integers `arr`, you are initially positioned at `start` index of the array. When you are at index `i`, you can jump to `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]`, check if you can reach to **any** index with value 0.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5

**Output:** true

**Explanation: **

All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are:

index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0

**Output:** true

**Explanation: **

One possible way to reach at index 3 with value 0 is:

index 0 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `0 <= arr[i] < arr.length`
* `0 <= start < arr.length`

## Solution
Use breadth first search to store whether each position can be reached.

Initially, the position is at `start` and only the `start` position is reached. At each step, get the current index of the array `index`, and get the value `arr[index]`, which represents the distance of the current jump. Set the positions `index - arr[index]` and `index + arr[index]` as visited if the positions are inside the array and haven't been visited before.

If at one step, an index with value 0 is reached, return `true`. If all possible positions have been visited but the value 0 is not met, return `false`.
