# 1316. Distinct Echo Substrings
## Level
Hard

## Description
Return the number of **distinct** non-empty substrings of `text` that can be written as the concatenation of some string with itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text = "abcabcabc"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The 3 substrings are "abcabc", "bcabca" and "cabcab".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text = "leetcodeleetcode"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The 2 substrings are "ee" and "leetcodeleetcode".

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= text.length <= 2000`

* `text` has only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Since the length of the string `text` is at most 2000, this problem can be solved in a way to check all substrings with even length.

For each substring with even length, check whether it is an echo substring. A string is an echo string if and only if the left half equals the right half. Use a `Set` to store all substrings that are echo substrings, and return the size of the `Set` as the number of distinct echo substrings.
