# 1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer `n`. No-Zero integer is a positive integer which **doesn't contain any 0** in its decimal representation.

Return a *list of two integers* `[A, B]` where:

* `A` and `B` are No-Zero integers.
* `A + B = n`

It's guarateed that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** [1,1]

**Explanation:** A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B don't contain any 0 in their decimal representation.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 11

**Output:** [2,9]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 10000

**Output:** [1,9999]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 69

**Output:** [1,68]

**Example 5:**

**Input**: n = 1010

**Output:** [11,999]

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^4`

## Solution
Since `n` is at most 10000, simply use brute force to find one solution.

Starting from 1, check whether both the current number `i` and the number `n - i` are no-zero integers. If both numbers are no-zero integers, return the two numbers.
