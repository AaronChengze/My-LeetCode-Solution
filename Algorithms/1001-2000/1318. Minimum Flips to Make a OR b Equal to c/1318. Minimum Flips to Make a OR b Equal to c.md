# 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make (`a` OR `b` == `c`). (bitwise OR operation).

Flip operation consists of change **any** single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = 2, b = 6, c = 5

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = 4, b = 2, c = 7

**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= a <= 10^9`
* `1 <= b <= 10^9`
* `1 <= c <= 10^9`

## Solution
Since `a`, `b` and `c` are all integers, each integer consists of 32 bits. For each bit, check whether the bitwise OR operation holds. If the bit in `c` is 0, then both the bit in `a` and the bit in `b` should be 0, and for both `a` and `b` change the bit to 0 if it is originally 1. If the bit in `c` is 0, then at least one bit from `a` or `b` should be 1, and change one bit to 1 if both the bit in `a` and the bit in `b` are 0. The operations described above are guaranteed to use the minimum flips since fewer flips won't make the bitwise OR operation hold. At the same time calculate the number of flips. Finally, return the number of flips, which is the minimum flips required.
