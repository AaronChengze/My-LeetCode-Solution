# 1331. Rank Transform of an Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array of integers `arr`, replace each element with its rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:

* Rank is an integer starting from 1.
* The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
* Rank should be as small as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [40,10,20,30]

**Output:** [4,1,2,3]

**Explanation:** 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [100,100,100]

**Output:** [1,1,1]

**Explanation:** Same elements share the same rank.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [37,12,28,9,100,56,80,5,12]

**Output:** [5,3,4,2,8,6,7,1,3]

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution
Since the data size may be very large, the algorithm should reduce time complexity.

Use a hash set to store the numbers in `arr`, then add the numbers from the hash set to a list, and sort the list. Use a map to store each element and its rank.

Create a new array `ranks` with the same length as `arr`, where `ranks[i]` is the rank of `arr[i]`. Finally, return `ranks`.
