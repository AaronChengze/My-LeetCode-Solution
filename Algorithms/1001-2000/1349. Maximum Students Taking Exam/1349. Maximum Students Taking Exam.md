# 1349. Maximum Students Taking Exam
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a `m * n` matrix seats  that represent seats distributions in a classroom. If a seat is broken, it is denoted by `'#'` character otherwise it is denoted by a `'.'` character.

Students can see the answers of those sitting next to the left, right, upper left and upper right, but he cannot see the answers of the student sitting directly in front or behind him. Return the **maximum** number of students that can take the exam together without any cheating being possible.

Students must be placed in seats in good condition.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: seats = [["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
                [".","#","#","#","#","."],
                ["#",".","#","#",".","#"]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Teacher can place 4 students in available seats so they don't cheat on the exam. 
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: seats = [[".","#"],
                ["#","#"],
                ["#","."],
                ["#","#"],
                [".","#"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Place all students in available seats. 
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: seats = [["#",".",".",".","#"],
                [".","#",".","#","."],
                [".",".","#",".","."],
                [".","#",".","#","."],
                ["#",".",".",".","#"]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Place students in available seats in column 1, 3 and 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `seats` contains only characters `'.'` and `'#'`.
* `m == seats.length`
* `n == seats[i].length`
* `1 <= m <= 8`
* `1 <= n <= 8`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. For each row, since there are `n` columns, there are a total number of `2 ^ n` states in each row. For each state, check whether it is legal using the following conditions.
1. All students are placed in seats in good condition.
2. For the current state, if shifting it to the left by one position or shifting it to the right by one position, there are no common positions that have 1 between the original state and the shifted state.
3. Apply condition 2 to the previous row's state and the current row's state. This condition is not needed for the first row.

For each row and each state, the maximum number of students can be obtained. Finally, check the last row and obtain the maximum number of students among all the states.
