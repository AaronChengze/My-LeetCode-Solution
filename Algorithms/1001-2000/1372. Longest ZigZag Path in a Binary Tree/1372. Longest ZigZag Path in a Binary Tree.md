# 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree `root`, a ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

* Choose **any** node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
* If the current direction is right then move to the right child of the current node otherwise move to the left child.
* Change the direction from right to left or right to left.
* Repeat the second and third step until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return the longest **ZigZag** path contained in that tree.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_2_1702.png)

**Input:** root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1]

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

* Each tree has at most `50000` nodes.
* Each node's value is between `[1, 100]`.

## Solution
For each node, use an array of length 2 to represent the length of the longest ZigZag path that ends at the node with the last move to the left and right, respectively. For the root, the corresponding array is `[0, 0]`.

Do breadth first search. For each node, obtain its array `[length0, length1]`, and obtain its two children. If the left child is not `null`, then update the left child's array as `[length1 + 1, 0]`, and offer the left child to the queue. If the right child is not `null`, then update the right child's array as `[0, length0 + 1]`, and offer the right child to the queue. Always update the maximum length when a new node is offered into the queue. Finally, return the maximum length.
