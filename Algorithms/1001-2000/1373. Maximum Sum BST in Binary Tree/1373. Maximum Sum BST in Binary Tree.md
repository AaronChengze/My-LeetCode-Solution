# 1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a **binary tree** `root`, the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of **any** sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/30/sample_1_1709.png)

**Input:** root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:** Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/30/sample_2_1709.png)

**Input:** root = [4,3,null,1,2]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in a single root node with key equal to 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [-4,-2,-5]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** All values are negatives. Return an empty BST.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = [2,1,3]

**Output:** 6

**Example 5:**

**Input:** root = [5,4,8,3,null,6,3]

**Output:** 7

**Constraints:**

* Each tree has at most `40000` nodes..
* Each node's value is between `[-4 * 10^4 , 4 * 10^4]`.

## Solution
For each node, use an array of length 4 to store the information of the subtree that has the current node as the root, including the minimum key in the subtree, the maximum key in the subtree, whether the subtree is a binary search tree, and the sum of all keys in the subtree. The first, second and fourth values are meaningful only when the subtree is a binary search tree. Use a map to store each node and its corresponding array.

Do breadth first search and use a list to store all the nodes in the order that they are visited. Then loop over the list in reversing order. For each node, if it is a leaf, then the subtree's minimum key and maximum key are both the node's key, it is a binary search tree and the sum of all keys in the subtree is the node's key. Otherwise, check its children. The current subtree is a binary search tree if and only if both children are binary search trees and the left subtree's maximum key is less than the current node's key and the right subtree's minimum key is greater than the current node's key (if the current node only has one child, then only consider the one child). If the current subtree is a binary search tree, then update its minimum key to be its left subtree's minimum key, update its maximum key to be its right subtree's maximum key, update it to be a binary search tree, and update the sum of all keys to be its left subtree's sum of all keys plus its right subtree's sum of all keys plus the current node's key. Update the maximum sum during the process.

Finally, return the maximum sum.
