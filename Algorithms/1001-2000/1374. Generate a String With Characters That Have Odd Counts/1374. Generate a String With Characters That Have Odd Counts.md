# 1374. Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer `n`, *return a string with `n` characters such that each character in such string occurs **an odd number of times***.

The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return **any** of them.  

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** "pppz"

**Explanation:** "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** "xy"

**Explanation:** "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 7

**Output:** "holasss"

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 500`

## Solution
There are many solutions to this problem. This solution is quite straightforward.

If `n` is odd, then simply create a string with length `n` and have all characters "a". Since "a" occurs `n` times, which is odd, the string is valid.

If `n` is even, then use 1 letter "a" and `n - 1` letters "b" to create a string with length `n`. Since both 1 and `n - 1` are odd, the string is valid.
