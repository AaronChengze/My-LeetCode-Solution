# 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two binary trees `original` and `cloned` and given a reference to a node `target` in the original tree.

The `cloned` tree is a **copy of** the `original` tree.

Return *a reference to the same node* in the `cloned` tree.

**Note** that you are **not allowed** to change any of the two trees or the `target` node and the answer **must be** a reference to a node in the `cloned` tree.

**Follow up:** Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tree = [7], target =  7

**Output:** 7

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4

**Output:** 4

**Example 4:**

**Input:** tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5

**Output:** 5

**Example 5:**

**Input:** tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2

**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
* The values of the nodes of the `tree` are unique.
* `target` node is a node from the `original` tree and is not `null`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search on both trees `original` and `cloned` simultaneously. Since the two trees have the same structure, for each node in `original`, there must be a corresponding node in `cloned`. If a node in `original` that is the same as `target` is met, then return the corresponding node in `cloned`.

Since this solution compares the nodes' references, not values, this solution is also valid if repeated values on the tree are allowed.
