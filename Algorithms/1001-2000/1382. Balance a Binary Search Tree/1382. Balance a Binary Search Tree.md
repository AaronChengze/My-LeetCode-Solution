# 1382. Balance a Binary Search Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary search tree, return a **balanced** binary search tree with the same node values.

A binary search tree is *balanced* if and only if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

If there is more than one answer, return any of them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]

**Output:** [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]

**Explanation:** This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2,null,null] is also correct.

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `10^4`.
* The tree nodes will have distinct values between `1` and `10^5`.

## Solution
Use a recursive way to solve this problem. If `root` is `null` or has no child, then simply return `root`. Otherwise, obtain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree, obtain the middle tree node in the inorder traversal (if there are even number of nodes, select the right one at the middle), and the remaining nodes form the left subtree and the right subtree respectively.
