A cinema has `n` rows of seats, numbered from 1 to `n` and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.

Given the array `reservedSeats` containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, `reservedSeats[i]=[3,8]` means the seat located in row **3** and labelled with **8** is already reserved. 

*Return the maximum number of four-person families you can allocate on the cinema seats.* A four-person family occupies fours seats **in one row**, that are **next to each other**. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be next to each other, however, It is permissible for the four-person family to be separated by an aisle, but in that case, **exactly two people** have to sit on each side of the aisle.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/14/cinema_seats_3.png)

**Input:** n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four families, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one family.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]

**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]

**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^9`
* `1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)`
* `reservedSeats[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n`
* `1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10`
* All `reservedSeats[i]` are distinct.

## Solution
A straightforward solution is to use a map to store each row's reserved seats. However, this may cause time limit exceeded or memory limit exceeded. A better way is to sort the reserved seats according to row numbers, and deal with each row separately.

After sorting `reservedSeats`, loop over `reservedSeats` and obtain all reserved seats in the current row, except seat 1 and seat 10. If a new row is met, calculate the previous row's maximum number of families, which can be 0, 1 or 2. Also consider the rows that do not have any reserved seat.

Finally, return the total number of families.
