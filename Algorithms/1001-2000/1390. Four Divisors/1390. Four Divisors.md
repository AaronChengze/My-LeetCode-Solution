# 1390. Four Divisors
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors.

If there is no such integer in the array, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [21,4,7]

**Output:** 32

**Explanation:**

21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21

4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4

7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7

The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution
If an integer has exactly four divisors, then the integer must be a composite number and there exists a prime number that can divide exactly the integer. After the devision, the quotient must be either the square of the prime number or **another** prime number.

Use the rule mentioned above to determine whether each integer in the array has exactly four divisors. If an integer has exactly four divisors, calculate the sum of divisors of the integer, and add the sum to the total sum. Finally, return the total sum.
