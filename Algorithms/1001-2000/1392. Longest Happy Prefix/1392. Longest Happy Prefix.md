# 1392. Longest Happy Prefix
## Level
Hard

## Description
A string is called a *happy prefix* if there is a **non-empty** prefix which is also a suffix (excluding itself).

Given a string `s`. Return the **longest happy prefix** of `s`.

Return an empty string if no such prefix exists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "level"

**Output:** "l"

**Explanation:** s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev", "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by "l".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "ababab"

**Output:** "abab"

**Explanation:** "abab" is the largest prefix which is also suffix. They can overlap in the original string.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "leetcodeleet"

**Output:** "leet"

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "a"

**Output:** ""

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use KMP algorithm to obtain an array of each index's prefix index. Since this problem requires that a prefix is also a suffix, after the array is obtained, obtain the array's last element `n`, and return `s.substring(0, n + 1)`.
