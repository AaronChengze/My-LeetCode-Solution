# 1399. Count Largest Group
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer `n`. Each number from `1` to `n` is grouped according to the sum of its digits. 

Return how many groups have the largest size.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 13

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. There are 4 groups with largest size.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 15

**Output:** 6

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 24

**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## Solution
Use a map to store each group and the number of integers in the group, where each group is represented by the sum of digits. Loop over the integers from 1 to `n`. For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits and increase the corresponding group's number of integers by 1. Also maintain the maximum count. Then loop over all the groups and count the number of groups with the maximum count and return the number of groups.
