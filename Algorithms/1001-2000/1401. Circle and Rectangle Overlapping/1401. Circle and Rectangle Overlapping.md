# 1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a circle represented as (`radius`, `x_center`, `y_center`) and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`), where (`x1`, `y1`) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (`x2`, `y2`) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return True if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return False.

In other words, check if there are **any** point (xi, yi) such that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** radius = 1, x_center = 0, y_center = 0, x1 = 1, y1 = -1, x2 = 3, y2 = 1

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Circle and rectangle share the point (1,0) 

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/20/sample_2_1728.png)

**Input:** radius = 1, x_center = 0, y_center = 0, x1 = -1, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = 1

**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/03/sample_6_1728.png)

**Input:** radius = 1, x_center = 1, y_center = 1, x1 = -3, y1 = -3, x2 = 3, y2 = 3

**Output:** true

**Example 4:**

**Input:** radius = 1, x_center = 1, y_center = 1, x1 = 1, y1 = -3, x2 = 2, y2 = -1

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= radius <= 2000`
* `-10^4 <= x_center, y_center, x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10^4`
* `x1 < x2`
* `y1 < y2`

## Solution
If the center of the circle is in the rectangle, return `true`.

If the x-coordinate of the center of the circle is between `x1` and `x2`, then return `true` if and only if `y_center` is between `y1 - radius` and `y2 + radius`.

If the y-coordinate of the center of the circle is between `y1` and `y2`, then return `true` if and only if `x_center` is between `x1 - radius` and `x2 + radius`.

Otherwise, calculate the distance between the center of the circoe and the closest corner of the rectangle, and return `true` if and only if the distance is less than or equal to `radius`.
