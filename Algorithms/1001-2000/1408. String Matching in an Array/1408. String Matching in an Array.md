# 1408. String Matching in an Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array of string `words`. Return all strings in `words` which is substring of another word in **any** order. 

String `words[i]` is substring of `words[j]`, if can be obtained removing some characters to left and/or right side of `words[j]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]

**Output:** ["as","hero"]

**Explanation:** "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["leetcode","et","code"]

**Output:** ["et","code"]

**Explanation:** "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["blue","green","bu"]

**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
* `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.
* It's **guaranteed** that `words[i]` will be unique.

## Solution
First, sort `words` according to the strings' lengths in ascending order. After sorting, if `words[i]` is a substring of `words[j]`, where `0 <= i < words.length` and `0 <= j < words.length`, then there must be `i < j`. Loop over `i` from 0 to `words.length - 1` and `j` from `i + 1` to `words.length - 1`. If `words[i]` is a substring of `words[j]`, then add `words[i]` to the result list and move to the next `i`. Finally, return the result list.
