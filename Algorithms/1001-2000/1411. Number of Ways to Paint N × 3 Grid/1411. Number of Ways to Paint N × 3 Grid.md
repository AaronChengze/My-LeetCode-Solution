# 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N Ã— 3 Grid
## Level
Hard

## Description
You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colours: **Red**, **Yellow** or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same colour (i.e no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same colour).

You are given `n` the number of rows of the grid.

Return *the number of ways* you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:** There are 12 possible ways to paint the grid as shown:

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** 54

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** 246

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 7

**Output:** 106494

**Example 5:**

**Input:** n = 5000

**Output:** 30228214

**Constraints:**

* `n == grid.length`
* `grid[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`

## Solution
For each row of `grid` that has length 3, there are two possible types to paint the row. The first type is "ABA", where the first cell and the third cell have the same colour and the second cell has a different colour. The second type is "ABC", where all cells' colours are different.

If the previous row's colours are determined, how to calculate the current row's number of ways? Consider the two types separately. Let A, B and C represent three colours.

If the previous row's colours are the first type "ABA", then the current row's colours can be "BAB", "BCB", "CAC", "BAC", and "CAB". It can be seen that for each way of the first type in the previous row, there are 3 ways of the first type and 2 ways of the second type in the current row.

If the previous row's colours are the second type "ABC", then the current row's colors can be "BAB", "BCB", "BCA" and "CAB". It can be seen that for each way of the second type in the previous row, there are 2 ways of the first type and 2 ways of the second type in the current row.

For the first row, there are 6 ways of the first type and 6 ways of the second type. For the second row to the last row, each row's ways of both types can be calculated, and the number of ways to paint the whole grid can be calculated. This can be done by dynamic programming.
