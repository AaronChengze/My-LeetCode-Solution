## Description
Given a list of lists of integers, `nums`, return all elements of `nums` in diagonal order as shown in the below images.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

**Output:** [1,4,2,7,5,3,8,6,9]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7],[8],[9,10,11],[12,13,14,15,16]]

**Output:** [1,6,2,8,7,3,9,4,12,10,5,13,11,14,15,16]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [[1,2,3],[4],[5,6,7],[8],[9,10,11]]

**Output:** [1,4,2,5,3,8,6,9,7,10,11]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [[1,2,3,4,5,6]]

**Output:** [1,2,3,4,5,6]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i].length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^9`
* There at most `10^5` elements in `nums`.

## Solution
Each number is at a position. If the positions can be sorted, then the elements in diagonal order can be obtained.

The positions are sorted as follows. First calculate the sum of each position's row and column. A position with a larger sum is greater. If two positions have the same sum, then the position with a smaller row is greater.

Use a priority queue to store all the positions. Loop over `nums`. For each row, obtain the number of columns in the row, and add each position in the row to the priority queue. Then poll the positions from the priority queue. Each time a position is polled, obtain the element at the position and put it into the result array. Finally, return the result array.
