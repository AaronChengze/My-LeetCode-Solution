# 1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One
## Level
Medium

## Description
(This problem is an **interactive problem**.)

A binary matrix means that all elements are `0` or `1`. For each **individual** row of the matrix, this row is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return leftmost column index (0-indexed) with at least a `1` in it. If such index doesn't exist, return `-1`.

**You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.** You may only access the matrix using a `BinaryMatrix` interface:

`BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index `(row, col)` (0-indexed).
`BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns a list of 2 elements `[rows, cols]`, which means the matrix is `rows * cols`.

Submissions making more than `1000` calls to `BinaryMatrix.get` will be judged Wrong Answer.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes you're given the binary matrix mat as input in the following four examples. You will not have access the binary matrix directly.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]

**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]

**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/25/untitled-diagram-3.jpg)

**Input:** mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]

**Output:** -1

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/25/untitled-diagram-6.jpg)

**Input:** mat = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1]]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `rows == mat.length`
* `cols == mat[i].length`
* `1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
* `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `mat[i]` is sorted in a non-decreasing way.

## Solution
First obtain `[rows, columns]` by calling `binaryMatrix.dimensions()`. Then initialize `leftMostColumn = columns` and do binary search in each row of `binrayMatrix`. For each row, initialize `low = 0` and `high = leftMostColumn - 1`, and do binary search if the element at column `high` is 1 (otherwise skip the row). Each time a smaller column that has 1 is found, update `leftMostColumn`. If `leftMostColumn` becomes 0, then break the loop. Finally, return `leftMostColumn` if it is less than `columns` or -1 otherwise.
