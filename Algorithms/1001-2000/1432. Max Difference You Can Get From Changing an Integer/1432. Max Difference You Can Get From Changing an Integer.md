# 1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an integer `num`. You will apply the following steps exactly **two** times:

* Pick a digit `x (0 <= x <= 9)`.
* Pick another digit `y (0 <= y <= 9)`. The digit `y` can be equal to `x`.
* Replace all the occurrences of `x` in the decimal representation of `num` by `y`.
* The new integer **cannot** have any leading zeros, also the new integer **cannot** be 0.

Let `a` and `b` be the results of applying the operations to `num` the first and second times, respectively.

Return *the max difference* between `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 555

**Output:** 888

**Explanation:** The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.

The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.

We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 9

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.

The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.

We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = 123456

**Output:** 820000

**Example 4:**

**Input:** num = 10000

**Output:** 80000

**Example 5:**

**Input:** num = 9288

**Output:** 8700

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num <= 10^8`

## Solution
Obviously, `a` is the maximum possible integer and `b` is the minimum possible integer.

To obtain `a`, find the highest digit that is not 9, and replace all the digits with the value to 9.

To obtain `b`, consider two cases.
1. If the highest digit is 1, then find the highest digit that is not 0 or 1, and replace all the digits with the value to 0. Note that the original digit cannot have value 1 since the highest digit cannot be changed to 0.
2. If the nighest digit is not 1, then simply replace all the digits with the same value as the highest digit to 1.

After obtaining `a` and `b`, return `a - b`.
