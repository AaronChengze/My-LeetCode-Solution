# 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from 0 to `n-1`, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. *Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend in order to collect all apples in the tree starting at **vertex 0** and coming back to this vertex.*

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `from_i` and `to_i`. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple, otherwise, it does not have any apple.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]

**Output:** 8 

**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]

**Output:** 6

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `edges.length == n-1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= fromi, toi <= n-1`
* `from_i < to_i`
* `hasApple.length == n`

## Solution
Use a map to store each node's adjacent nodes. Do breadth first search starting from node 0 to find the distance between each node and node 0, and find each node's parent and children (each node's parent and children are considered when node 0 is the root of the tree). Then starting from the nodes that has apples, find the paths that reaches node 0. Each edge is only visited once. Count the number of edges that are visited and return twice the number of edges (when collecting apples, walk to a node from node 0 and then walk back to node 0, so if an edge has been walked on, it has been walked on twice).
