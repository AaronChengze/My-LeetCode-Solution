# 1446. Consecutive Characters
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `s`, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the *power* of the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "triplepillooooow"

**Output:** 5

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"

**Output:** 11

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s = "tourist"

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
If `s` is non-empty, then the power of `s` is at least 1. Loop over `s` once and check whether the current character is the same as the previous character. If so, increase the number of consecutive characters by 1 and update the power. Otherwise, set the current number of consecutive characters to 1. Finally, return the power.
