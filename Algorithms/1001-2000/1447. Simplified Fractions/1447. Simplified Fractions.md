# 1447. Simplified Fractions
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return a list of all **simplified** fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to `n`. The fractions can be in **any** order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** ["1/2"]

**Explanation:** "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** ["1/2","1/3","2/3"]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** ["1/2","1/3","1/4","2/3","3/4"]

**Explanation:** "2/4" is not a simplified fraction because it can be simplified to "1/2".

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`

## Solution
If `n == 1`, return an empty list.

For a fraction `a/b` where `a < b` that is a simplified fraction, `(b-a)/b` must also be a simplified fraction. To avoid duplicates, first add `1/2` to the result list.

Then for the denominator `b` from 3 to `n`, consider all possible numerators `a` that are at most half of the denominator and are relative prime to the denominator, and for each such numerator, add `a/b` and `(b-a)/b` to the result list.

Finally, return the result list.
