# 1478. Allocate Mailboxes
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given the array `houses` and an integer `k`, where `houses[i]` is the location of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate `k` mailboxes in the street.

Return the **minimum** total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.

Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5 

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/sample_2_1816.png)

**Input:** houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.

Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** houses = [7,4,6,1], k = 1

**Output:** 8

**Example 4:**

**Input:** houses = [3,6,14,10], k = 4

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

* `n == houses.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= houses[i] <= 10^4`
* `1 <= k <= n`
* Array `houses` contain unique integers.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `n + 1` rows and `k + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum distance of the range of length `i` when divided into `j` sections, and the target is `dp[n][k]`.

Firs calculate the distances between each pair of houses. Then calculate the values of `dp`.
