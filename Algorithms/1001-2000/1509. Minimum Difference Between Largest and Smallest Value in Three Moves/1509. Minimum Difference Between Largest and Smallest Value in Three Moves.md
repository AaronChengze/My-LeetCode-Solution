# 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `nums`, you are allowed to choose one element of `nums` and change it by any value in one move.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` after perfoming at most 3 moves.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,3,2,4]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].

The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,0,10,14]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 

The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]

**Output:** 2

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,6,14,15]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution
Obviously, if the array's length is less than or equal to 4, then it is always possible to make all the values in `nums` the same, so return 0. Therefore, only the cases where the array's length is greater than 5 need to be considered.

Sort the array `nums`. After three moves, it is always possible to make the largest value and the smallest value be the elements at the two indices that differ by `nums.length - 4`. Loop over `nums` and calculate the differences between the elements that have indices differ by `nums.length - 4`, obtain the minimum difference, and return.
