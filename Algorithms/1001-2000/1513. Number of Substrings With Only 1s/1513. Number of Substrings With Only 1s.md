# 1513. Number of Substrings With Only 1s
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of '0' and '1's).

Return the number of substrings with all characters 1's.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "0110111"

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** There are 9 substring in total with only 1's characters.

"1" -> 5 times.

"11" -> 3 times.

"111" -> 1 time.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "101"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Substring "1" is shown 2 times in s.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "111111"

**Output:** 21

**Explanation:** Each substring contains only 1's characters.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "000"

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

* `s[i] == '0'` or `s[i] == '1'`
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`

## Solution
Loop over the string `s` and find all the longest substrings that contain only 1's characters. The term "longest" here means that for any substring in the indices range `[i, j]` both inclusive, which contains only 1's characters, `s.charAt(i - 1)` and `s.charAt(j + 1)` are either 0's or out of the indices bound.

For each longest substring that contains only 1's characters, if the length is `consecutive`, then add `consecutive * (consecutive + 1) / 2` to the final result.
