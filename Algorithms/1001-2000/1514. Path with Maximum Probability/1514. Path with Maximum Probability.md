# 1514. Path with Maximum Probability
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from `start` to `end`, **return 0**. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most **1e-5**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2

**Output:** 0.25000

**Explanation:** There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2

**Output:** 0.30000

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/20/1558_ex3.png)

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2

**Output:** 0.00000

**Explanation:** There is no path between 0 and 2.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^4`
* `0 <= start, end < n`
* `start != end`
* `0 <= a, b < n`
* `a != b`
* `0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4`
* `0 <= succProb[i] <= 1`
* There is at most one edge between every two nodes.

## Solution
Use one map to store each node's adjacent nodes, and use the second map to store each node's corresponding nodes' probabilities. Initialize both maps using `edges` and `succProb`.

Then use breadth first search. Starting from node `start`, which has probability 1, each time obtain the node's all adjacent nodes and the corresponding probabilities. If an adjacent node will have a higher probability after applying the path, then update the adjacent node's probability and offer the adjacent node to the queue for the next time's search.

Finally, return node `end`'s probability.
