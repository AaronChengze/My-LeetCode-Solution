# 1516. Move Sub-Tree of N-Ary Tree
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given the `root` of an [N-ary tree](https://leetcode.com/articles/introduction-to-n-ary-trees/) of unique values, and two nodes of the tree `p` and `q`.

You should move the subtree of the node `p` to become a direct child of node `q`. If `p` is already a direct child of `q`, don't change anything. Node `p` **must be** the last child in the children list of node `q`.

Return the root of the tree after adjusting it.

There are 3 cases for nodes `p` and `q`:

1. Node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.
2. Node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q`.
3. Neither node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q` nor node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.

In cases 2 and 3, you just need to move `p` (with its sub-tree) to be a child of `q`, but in case 1 the tree may be disconnected, thus you need to reconnect the tree again. **Please read the examples carefully before solving this problem.**

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

For example, the above tree is serialized as [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/13/move_e1.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 4, q = 1

**Output:** [1,null,2,3,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,8]

**Explanation:** This example follows the second case as node p is in the sub-tree of node q. We move node p with its sub-tree to be a direct child of node q.

Notice that node 4 is the last child of node 1.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/13/move_e2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 7, q = 4

**Output:** [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8]

**Explanation:** Node 7 is already a direct child of node 4. We don't change anything.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/13/move_e3.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 3, q = 8

**Output:** [1,null,2,null,4,5,null,7,8,null,null,null,3,null,6]

**Explanation:** This example follows case 3 because node p is not in the sub-tree of node q and vice-versa. We can move node 3 with its sub-tree and make it as node 8's child.

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/13/move_e4.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 2, q = 7

**Output:** [1,null,7,3,null,2,null,6,null,4,5,null,null,8]

**Explanation:** Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.

The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.

Then we will see that the tree is disconnected, you need to reconnect node q to replace node p as shown.

**Example 5:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/13/move_e5.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 1, q = 2

**Output:** [2,null,4,5,1,null,7,8,null,null,3,null,null,null,6]

**Explanation:** Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.
The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.

As node p was the root of the tree, node q replaces it and becomes the root of the tree.

**Constraints:**

* The total number of nodes is between `[2, 1000]`.
* Each node has a **unique** value.
* `p != null`
* `q != null`
* `p` and `q` are two different nodes (i.e. `p != q`).

## Solution
Do depth first search to find each node's parent. If node `q` is already the parent of node `p`, then simply return the original tree.

Otherwise, check whether node `q` is in the subtree of node `p`. If node `p` is not the root of the N-ary tree, then if node `q` is in the subtree of node `p`, remove node `q` from its parent's children and replace node `p` with node `q` in node `p`'s children. If node `q` is not in the subtree of node `p`, remove node `p` from its parent's children. Finally add node `p` to node `q`'s children, and return the N-ary tree's root.

If node `p` is the root of the N-ary tree, then remove node `q` from its parent's children, add node `p` to node `q`'s children, and return node `q` as the root of the new N-ary tree.
