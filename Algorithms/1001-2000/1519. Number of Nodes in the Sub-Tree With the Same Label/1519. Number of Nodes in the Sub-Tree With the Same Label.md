# 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` `edges`. The **root** of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has **a label** which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).

The `edges` array is given on the form `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]`, which means there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.

Return *an array of size `n`* where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `i-th` node which have the same label as node `i`.

A subtree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"

**Output:** [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]

**Explanation:** Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.

Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/q3e2.jpg)

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = "bbbb"

**Output:** [4,2,1,1]

**Explanation:** The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.

The sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/q3e3.jpg)

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[0,4]], labels = "aabab"

**Output:** [3,2,1,1,1]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[3,4],[4,5]], labels = "cbabaa"

**Output:** [1,2,1,1,2,1]

**Example 5:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6]], labels = "aaabaaa"

**Output:** [6,5,4,1,3,2,1]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
* `a_i != b_i`
* `labels.length == n`
* `labels` is consisting of only of lower-case English letters.

## Solution
Use a map to store the information of the edges. Use a second map to store each node's parent. Use another map to store each node's number of labels in its subtree. Starting from node 0, do breadth first search and store the result of level order traversal. At the same time, update each node's parent and each node's number of labels in itself.

After level order traversal, visit the nodes in the reversing order (i.e. starting from leaves and ending at the root). For each node, obtain the number of nodes with the given label in its subtree, store the value in the result array, and update its labels information to its parent. Finally, return the result array.
