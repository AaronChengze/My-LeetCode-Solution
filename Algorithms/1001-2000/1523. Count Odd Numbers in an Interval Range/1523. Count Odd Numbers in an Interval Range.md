# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the *count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive)*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** low = 3, high = 7

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** low = 8, high = 10

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= low <= high <= 10^9`

## Solution
First, make sure both `low` and `high` are odd numbers. Therefore, if `low` is even, increase `low` by 1, and if `high` is even, decrease `high` by 1. Then the number of odd numbers in the interval range is `(high - low) / 2 + 1`.
