# 1524. Number of Sub-arrays With Odd Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `arr`. Return *the number of sub-arrays* with **odd** sum.

As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,3,5]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** All sub-arrays are [[1],[1,3],[1,3,5],[3],[3,5],[5]]

All sub-arrays sum are [1,4,9,3,8,5].

Odd sums are [1,9,3,5] so the answer is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [2,4,6]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** All sub-arrays are [[2],[2,4],[2,4,6],[4],[4,6],[6]]

All sub-arrays sum are [2,6,12,4,10,6].

All sub-arrays have even sum and the answer is 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

**Output:** 16

**Example 4:**

**Input:** arr = [100,100,99,99]

**Output:** 4

**Example 5:**

**Input:** arr = [7]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 100`

## Solution
Loop over `arr` and obtain the differences between the indices of each adjacent pair of odd numbers. The differences are calculated under the assumption that there is an odd number at index `-1` of `arr` and there is an odd number at index `arr.length` of `arr`. Use a list to store the differences between the indices. Then calculate the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list, which is the even sum, and calculate the sum of all the elements at odd indices of the list, which is the odd sum. Finally, calculate the product of the even sum and the odd sum.
