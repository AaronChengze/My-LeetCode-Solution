# 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length **6** is labelled as follows:

Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return *the minimum total cost* of the cuts.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]

**Output**: 16

**Explanation:** Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/21/e11.jpg)

The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.

Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]

**Output:** 22

**Explanation:** If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.
There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^6`
* `1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`
* `1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
* All the integers in `cuts` array are **distinct**.

## Solution
This is a problem of dynamic programming. This solution uses searching with memorization.

Sort the array `cuts`. For each pair of adjacent cuts, if the indices are `i` and `j` where `i < j`, then the interval `[i, j]` of the stick has cost 0, since no cut is needed. If there are three cuts such that `i < j < k`, then if a cuts is performed at index `j`, then the cost of the interval `[i, k]` of the stick consists of three parts, which are `k - i`, the cost of the interfal `[i, j]`, and the cost of the interval `[j, k]`. This can be solved by using recursion with memorization.

Finally, return the total cost of the interval `[0, n]`, which is the whole stick.
