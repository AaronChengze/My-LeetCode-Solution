# 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls
## Level
Medium

## Description
In universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `i-th` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return *the required force*.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/11/q3v1.jpg)

**Input:** position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2

**Output:** 999999999

**Explanation:** We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.

**Constraints:**

* `n == position.length`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`
* All integers in `position` are **distinct**.
* `2 <= m <= position.length`

## Solution
Use binary search. Initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to the maximum distance between the baskets. Each time set `mid = (high - low + 1) / 2 + low` (note that `+ 1` is necessary), use `mid` as the distance and check whether the distance meets the requirement that all balls can be put into the basket and any two balls' distance is at least `mid`. If so, set `low = mid`. Otherwise, set `high = mid - 1`. Finally, return `low`, which is the maximum possible distance and the required force.
