# 1554. Strings Differ by One Character
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a list of strings `dict` where all the strings are of the same length.

Return `True` if there are 2 strings that only differ by 1 character in the same index, otherwise return `False`.

**Follow up:** Could you solve this problem in O(n*m) where n is the length of `dict` and m is the length of each string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dict = ["abcd","acbd", "aacd"]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Strings "a**b**cd" and "a**a**cd" differ only by one character in the index 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dict = ["ab","cd","yz"]

**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** dict = ["abcd","cccc","abyd","abab"]

**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

* Number of characters in `dict <= 10^5`
* `dict[i].length == dict[j].length`
* `dict[i]` should be unique.
* `dict[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
One straightforward solution is to compare all pairs of words in `dict`. If there exist two words in `dict` that differ by 1 character in the same index, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

For the follow-up question, one possible way is to create a hash function for strings, and use hash values of each string to check whether there exist two words that differ by 1 character in the same index.
