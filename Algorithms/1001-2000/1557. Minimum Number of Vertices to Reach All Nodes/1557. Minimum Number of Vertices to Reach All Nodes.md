# 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` represents a directed edge from node `from_i` to node `to_i`.

Find *the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable*. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]

**Output:** [0,3]

**Explanation:** It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]

**Output:** [0,2,3]

**Explanation:** Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= from_i, to_i < n`
* All pairs `(from_i, to_i)` are distinct.

## Solution
Since the graph is directed and acyclic, if a vertex is the end of an edge, then the vertex is always reachable from another vertex. Therefore, loop over all edges and find the vertices that are not the end vertex of any edge, and return such vertices.
