Your task is to form an integer array `nums` from an initial array of zeros `arr` that is the same size as `nums`.

Return the minimum number of function calls to make `nums` from `arr`.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** Increment by 1 (second element): [0, 0] to get [0, 1] (1 operation).

Double all the elements: [0, 1] -> [0, 2] -> [0, 4] (2 operations).

Increment by 1 (both elements)  [0, 4] -> [1, 4] -> **[1, 5]** (2 operations).

Total of operations: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Increment by 1 (both elements) [0, 0] -> [0, 1] -> [1, 1] (2 operations).

Double all the elements: [1, 1] -> **[2, 2]** (1 operation).

Total of operations: 2 + 1 = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,2,5]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** (initial)[0,0,0] -> [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1] -> [2,0,2] -> [2,1,2] -> [4,2,4] -> **[4,2,5]**(nums).

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,2,4]

**Output:** 7

**Example 5:**

**Input:** nums = [2,4,8,16]

**Output:** 8

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution
Obviously, multiplying all elements by 2 can change more elements at the same time, so this function call should be used as long as possible.

Use a greedy approach. Consider the operations backwards. If a number is odd, then it must have been added by 1 in the previous function call, so subtract 1 from the number and increase the number of function calls by 1. After all the numbers in the array become even, divide all elements by 2 and increase the number of function calls by 1, as long as there is at least one element that is greater than 0. Finally, return the number of function calls.
