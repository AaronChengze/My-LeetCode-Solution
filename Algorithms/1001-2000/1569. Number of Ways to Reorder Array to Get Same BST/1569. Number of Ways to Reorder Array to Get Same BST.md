# 1569. Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array `nums` that represents a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of `nums` in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder `nums` so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array `nums`.

For example, given `nums = [2,1,3]`, we will have 2 as the root, 1 as a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array `[2,3,1]` also yields the same BST but `[3,2,1]` yields a different BST.

Return *the number of ways to reorder `nums` such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from `nums`*.

Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,1,3]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** We can reorder nums to be [2,3,1] which will yield the same BST. There are no other ways to reorder nums which will yield the same BST.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/12/ex1.png)

**Input:** nums = [3,4,5,1,2]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The following 5 arrays will yield the same BST:

[3,1,2,4,5]

[3,1,4,2,5]

[3,1,4,5,2]

[3,4,1,2,5]

[3,4,1,5,2]

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/12/ex4.png)

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There are no other orderings of nums that will yield the same BST.

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/12/abc.png)

**Input:** nums = [3,1,2,5,4,6]

**Output:** 19

**Example 5:**

**Input:** nums = [9,4,2,1,3,6,5,7,8,14,11,10,12,13,16,15,17,18]

**Output:** 216212978

**Explanation:** The number of ways to reorder nums to get the same BST is 3216212999. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives 216212978.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`
* All integers in `nums` are **distinct**.

## Solution
First, calculate all possible combination values `C(m, k)` where `0 <= k <= m <= n`. For each pair of `(m, k)`, there is `C(m, 0) = 1` and `C(m, k) = C(m - 1, k) + C(m - 1, k - 1)`.

Then calculate the number of ways of the array to get the same BST, including the original way. The first element of the array is the root of the BST. For the remaining elements, each element is either in the left subtree or the right subtree. Calculate the number of ways for both the left subtree and the right subtree, using the values and the sizes of the two subtrees. This can be done in recursion.

Finally, after the number of ways of the whole BST, return the number of ways minus 1 (since the original array should be excluded).
