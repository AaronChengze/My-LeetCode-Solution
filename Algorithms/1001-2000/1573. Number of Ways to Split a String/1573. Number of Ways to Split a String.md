# 1573. Number of Ways to Split a String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of '0's and '1's), we can split `s` into 3 **non-empty** strings s1, s2, s3 (s1+ s2+ s3 = s).

Return the number of ways `s` can be split such that the number of characters '1' is the same in s1, s2, and s3.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "10101"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** There are four ways to split s in 3 parts where each part contain the same number of letters '1'.

"1|010|1"

"1|01|01"

"10|10|1"

"10|1|01"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "1001"

**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "0000"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** There are three ways to split s in 3 parts.

"0|0|00"

"0|00|0"

"00|0|0"

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "100100010100110"

**Output:** 12

**Constraints:**

* `s[i] == '0'` or `s[i] == '1'`
* `3 <= s.length <= 10^5`

## Solution
First count the number of characters '1' in `s`. If the count is not divisible by 3, then it is impossible to split `s` into 3 non-empty strings such that each string contains the same number of characters '1', so return 0.

If there is no character '1' in `s`, then suppose `s` has length `n`, and the number of ways is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.

If there are `m` characters '1' in `s`, then find the `m / 3`-th character '1' and the `m * 2 / 3`-th character '1', count their distances to their previous characters '1', respectively. Suppose the distances are `n1` and `n2` respectively. The number of ways is `n1 * n2`.
