# 1579. Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable
## Level
Hard

## Description
Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of n nodes and 3 types of edges:

* Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
* Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
* Type 3: Can by traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [type_i, u_i, v_i]` represents a bidirectional edge of type `type_i` between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.

Return *the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return `-1` if it's impossible for the graph to be fully traversed by Alice and Bob*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/19/ex2.png)

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/19/ex3.png)

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[3,2,3],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** In the current graph, Alice cannot reach node 4 from the other nodes. Likewise, Bob cannot reach 1. Therefore it's impossible to make the graph fully traversable.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, 3 * n * (n-1) / 2)`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= edges[i][0] <= 3`
* `1 <= edges[i][1] < edges[i][2] <= n`
* All tuples `(type_i, u_i, v_i)` are distinct.

## Solution
Use union find. First loop over all edges of type 3 and update all nodes' parents. Then loop over all edges of type 1 and type 2 and update all node's parents. At the same time, count the number of nodes that can be visited by Alice and Bob. If either Alice or Bob cannot visit all `n` nodes, return -1. Otherwise, the max number of edges that can be removed is the number of edges minus the total number of nodes visited.
