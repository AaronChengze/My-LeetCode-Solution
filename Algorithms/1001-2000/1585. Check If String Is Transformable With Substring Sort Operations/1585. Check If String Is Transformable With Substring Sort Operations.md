# 1585. Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, you want to transform string `s` into string `t` using the following operation any number of times:

* Choose a **non-empty** substring in `s` and sort it in-place so the characters are in **ascending order**.

For example, applying the operation on the substring in `"1[4234]"` results in `"1[2344]"`.

Return `true` if *it is possible to transform string `s` into string `t`*. Otherwise, return `false`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "84532", t = "34852"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:

"84532" (from index 2 to 3) -> "84352"

"84352" (from index 0 to 2) -> "34852"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "34521", t = "23415"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:

"34521" -> "23451"

"23451" -> "23415"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "12345", t = "12435"

**Output:** false

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "1", t = "2"

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `s.length == t.length`
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` and `t` only contain digits from `'0'` to `'9'`.

## Solution
First check whether `s` and `t` have the same number of occurrences for each digit. If this is not the case, return `false`.

Then loop over `s` and for each digit, store the indices of the digit in `s` in reversing order. Next, loop over `t`. For each character in `t`, which corresponds to the digit `digit`, find the smallest index of `digit` in `s`. Loop over `j` from 0 to `digit - 1`. If there exists a `j` such that the smallest index of `j` in `s` is greater than the smallest index of `digit` in `s`, return `false`.

If no contradiction is met, return `true`.
