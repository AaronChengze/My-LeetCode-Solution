# 1590. Make Sum Divisible by P
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the **smallest** subarray (possibly **empty**) such that the **sum** of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is **not** allowed to remove the whole array.

Return *the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or `-1` if it's impossible*.

A **subarray* is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], p = 3

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], p = 7

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There is no way to remove a subarray in order to get a sum divisible by 7.

**Example 5:**

**Input:** nums = [1000000000,1000000000,1000000000], p = 3

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:8*

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= p <= 10^9`

## Solution
First calculate the sum of all elements in `nums`. If the sum is divisible by `p`, return 0.

Otherwise, use a map to store each remainder and the last index of the remainder. Loop over `nums` again and for each index, calculate the current remainder of the sum, and find the previous remainder to make sum divisible by `p`. If the previous remainder is in the map, find the index of the previous remainder and update the minimum length of the subarray.

Finally, if the minimum length equals the length of `nums`, return -1. Otherwise, return the minimum length.
