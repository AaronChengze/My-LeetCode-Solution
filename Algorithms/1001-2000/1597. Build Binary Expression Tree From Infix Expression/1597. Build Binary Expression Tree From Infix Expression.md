# 1597. Build Binary Expression Tree From Infix Expression
## Level
Medium

## Description
A **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

For each internal node with operator `o`, the **[infix expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation)** that it represents is `(A o B)`, where `A` is the expression the left subtree represents and `B` is the expression the right subtree represents.

You are given a string `s`, an **infix expression** containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses `'('` and `')'`.

Return *the **binary expression tree** that represents `s`*.

**Please note that order of operations applies in `s`**. That is, expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

Hint: An **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of the binary expression tree should reproduce `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "2-3/(5*2)+1"

**Output:** [+,-,1,2,/,null,null,null,null,3,*,null,null,5,2]

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/20/sample_2_1978.png)

**Input:** s = "3*4-2*5"

**Output:** [-,*,*,3,4,2,5]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1+2+3+4+5"

**Output:** [+,+,5,+,4,null,null,+,3,null,null,1,2]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of digits and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'`, `'('`, and `')'`.
* Operands in `s` are **exactly** 1 digit.
* It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.

## Solution
Use two stacks to store operators and nodes respectively. Loop over `s`. If a digit is met, create a node using the digit and push the node into the node stack. Otherwise, push the operator into the operator stack. If the current operator has a precedence equal to or lower than the operator at the top of the operator stack, then pop the operators from the operator stack until the operator stack becomes empty or the operator at the top of the operator stack has a lower precedence. Each time an operator is popped from the operator stack (`'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'` or `'/'`), pop two nodes from the node stack and create a new node using the popped operator and two popped nodes. After `s` is looped over, as long as the operator stack is not empty, pop the operators and create new nodes until the operator stack becomes empty. Finally, return the last node created.
