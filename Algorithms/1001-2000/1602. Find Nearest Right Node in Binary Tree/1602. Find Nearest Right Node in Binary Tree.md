# 1602. Find Nearest Right Node in Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree and a node u in the tree, return the nearest node on the same level that is to the right of u, or return null if u is the rightmost node in its level.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,6], u = 4

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The nearest node on the same level to the right of node 4 is node 5.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/23/p2.png)

**Input:** root = [3,null,4,2], u = 2

**Output:** null

**Explanation:** There are no nodes to the right of 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1], u = 1

**Output:** null

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = [3,4,2,null,null,null,1], u = 4

**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
* All values in the tree are `distinct`.
* `u` is a node in the binary tree rooted at `root`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search on the binary tree. Each time visit all nodes in the same level. If `u` is met, check whether it is the last node of the current level. If it is the last node of the current level, return `null`. Otherwise, return the next node of `u`.
