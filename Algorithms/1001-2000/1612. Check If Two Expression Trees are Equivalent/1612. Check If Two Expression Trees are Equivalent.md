## Level
Medium

## Description
A **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (variables), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators. In this problem, we only consider the `'+'` operator (i.e. addition).

You are given the roots of two binary expression trees, `root1` and `root2`. Return `true` *if the two binary expression trees are equivalent*. Otherwise, return `false`.

Two binary expression trees are equivalent if they **evaluate to the same value** regardless of what the variables are set to.

**Follow up:** What will you change in your solution if the tree also supports the `'-'` operator (i.e. subtraction)?

**Example 1:**

**Input: root1 = [x], root2 = [x]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,b,c,a]

**Output:** true

**Explaination:** a + (b + c) == (b + c) + a

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/tree2.png)

**Input:** root1 = [+,a,+,null,null,b,c], root2 = [+,+,b,d,a]

**Output:** false

**Explaination:** a + (b + c) != (b + d) + a

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in both trees are equal, odd and, in the range `[1, 4999]`.
* `Node.val` is `'+'` or a lower-case English letter.
* It's **guaranteed** that the tree given is a valid binary expression tree.

## Solution
Since only the addition operator is considered, two expression trees are equivalent if and only if the two expression trees contain exactly the same letters (for any letter, the two expression trees contain the same number of such letter). Therefore, do depth first search on both expression trees and count the number of occurrences of each letter. Finally, check whether the two expression trees contain exactly the same number of occurrences of each letter.
