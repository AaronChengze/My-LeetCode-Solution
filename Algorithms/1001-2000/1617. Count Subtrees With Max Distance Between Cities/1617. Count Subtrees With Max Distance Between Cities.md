# 1617. Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities
## Level
Hard

## Description
There are `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given an array `edges` of size `n-1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` represents a bidirectional edge between cities ui and vi. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a **tree**.

A **subtree** is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.

For each `d` from `1` to `n-1`, find the number of subtrees in which the **maximum distance** between any two cities in the subtree is equal to `d`.

Return *an array of size `n-1` where the `d-th` element **(1-indexed)** is the number of subtrees in which the **maximum distance** between any two cities is equal to `d`*.

**Notice** that the **distance** between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]

**Output:** [3,4,0]

**Explanation:**

The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.

The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max distance of 2.

No subtree has two nodes where the max distance between them is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, edges = [[1,2]]

**Output:** [1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3]]

**Output:** [2,1]

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 15`
* `edges.length == n-1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
* All pairs `(u_i, v_i)` are distinct.

## Solution
Since `n` is limited, simply enumerate all possible combinations of selected edges. For each combination, first check whether the selected edges form a subtree (that is, the selected edges must make all the relevant nodes connected), and then calculate the max distance between cities of the subtree, with the result array updated. Finally, return the result array.
