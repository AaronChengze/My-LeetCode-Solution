# 1621. Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `i-th` point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw **exactly** `k` **non-overlapping** line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have **integral coordinates**. The `k` line segments **do not** have to cover all `n` points, and they are **allowed** to share endpoints.

Return *the number of ways we can draw `k` non-overlapping line segments*. Since this number can be huge, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/07/ex1.png)

**Input:** n = 4, k = 2

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

The two line segments are shown in red and blue.

The image above shows the 5 different ways {(0,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,3)}, {(0,1),(2,3)}, {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,2)}.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The 3 ways are {(0,1)}, {(0,2)}, {(1,2)}.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 30, k = 7

**Output:** 796297179

**Explanation:** The total number of possible ways to draw 7 line segments is 3796297200. Taking this number modulo 109 + 7 gives us 796297179.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 5, k = 3

**Output:** 7

**Example 5:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= n-1`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 3D array `dp` of size `n * (k + 1) * 2`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sets of points from 0 to `i` with `j` line segments. Concretely, `dp[i][j][0]` represents the case where the `j`-th line segment's right endpoint is not `i`, and `dp[i][j][1]` represents the case where the `j`-th line segment's right endpoint is `i`.

The base case is `dp[0][0][0] = 1`. To calculate `dp[i][j]` where `i >= 1` and `j >= 0`, there is `dp[i][j][0] = dp[i - 1][j][0] + dp[i - 1][j][1]` and `dp[i][j][1] = dp[i - 1][j][1] + dp[i - 1][j - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][j - 1][1]`. Finally, return the sum of `dp[n - 1][k][0]` and `dp[n - 1][k][1]`.
