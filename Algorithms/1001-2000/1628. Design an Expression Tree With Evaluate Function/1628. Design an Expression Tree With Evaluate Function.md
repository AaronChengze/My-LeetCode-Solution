# 1628. Design an Expression Tree With Evaluate Function
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return *the binary expression tree that represents this expression*.

**Postfix** notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(2+7))` are represented in the array `postfix = ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]`.

The class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.

A **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `10^9` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).

**Follow up:** Could you design the expression tree such that it is more modular? For example, is your design able to support additional operators without making changes to your existing evaluate implementation?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = ["3","4","+","2","*","7","/"]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression ((3+4)*2)/7) = 14/7 = 2.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/untitled-diagram2.png)

**Input:** s = ["4","5","7","2","+","-","*"]

**Output:** -16

**Explanation:** this expression evaluates to the above binary tree with expression 4*(5-(2+7)) = 4*(-4) = -16.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = ["4","2","+","3","5","1","-","*","+"]

**Output:** 18

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = ["100","200","+","2","/","5","*","7","+"]

**Output:** 757

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length < 100`
* `s.length` is odd.
* `s` consists of numbers and the characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
* If `s[i]` is a number, its integer representation is no more than `10^5`.
* It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid expression.
* The absolute value of the result and intermediate values will not exceed `10^9`.
* It is guaranteed that no expression will include division by zero.

## Solution
Create two classes that implement class `Node`. The class `NumNode` is for the nodes with a single number. The class `OpNode` is for the nodes with an operator and two children. To reduce time complexity, once a node is created, its value is calculated as well.

For `buildTree`, maintain a stack and loop over `postfix` from left to right. If a number is met, create a `NumNode` and push it into the stack. Otherwise, pop two nodes from the stack, create a `OpNode` with the two nodes as its children (the first popped node is the right child and the second popped node is the left child), and push int into the stack. Finally, there is one node in the stack, so pop it and return.
