# 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return *the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) and are **lexicographically sorted***.

A string `s` is **lexicographically sorted** if for all valid `i`, `s[i]` is the same as or comes before `s[i+1]` in the alphabet.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:** The 15 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are
["aa","ae","ai","ao","au","ee","ei","eo","eu","ii","io","iu","oo","ou","uu"].
Note that "ea" is not a valid string since 'e' comes after 'a' in the alphabet.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 33

**Output:** 66045

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 50`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `n` rows and 5 columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sorted vowel strings of length `i + 1` with the first `j + 1` vowel letters. Initially, `dp[0][i] = i + 1` for `0 <= i < 5`, and `dp[i][0] = 1` for `0 <= i < n`. For `1 <= i < n` and `1 <= j < 5`, there is `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]`. Finally, return `dp[n - 1][4]`.
