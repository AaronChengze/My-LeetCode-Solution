# 1644. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, `p` and `q`*. If either node `p` or `q` **does not exist** in the tree, return `null`. All values of the nodes in the tree are **unique**.

According to the **[definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)**: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as **descendants** (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)". A **descendant** of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition of LCA.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10

**Output:** null

**Explanation:** Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`

## Solution
This problem is similar to problem 236, with the difference that node `p` and node `q` are not always in the binary tree.

First do depth first search on the binary tree to find the nodes `p` and `q`. If either node does not exist, return `null`.

If both `p` and `q` are in the binary tree, then do depth first search again to find the lowest common ancestor.
