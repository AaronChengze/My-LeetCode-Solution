# 1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'` and `'b'`.

You can delete any number of characters in `s` to make `s` **balanced**. `s` is balanced if there is no pair of indices `(i,j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] = 'b'` and `s[j]= 'a'`.

Return *the **minimum** number of deletions needed to make `s` **balanced***.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aababbab"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You can either:

Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or

Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "bbaaaaabb"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The only solution is to delete the first two characters.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s[i]` is `'a'` or `'b'`.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let `n` be the length of string `s`. Create a 2D array `dp` of `n` rows and 2 columns, where `dp[i][0]` and `dp[i][1]` represents the minimum deletions needed for the first `i + 1` characters in `s` to be balanced when the `i`-th letter is `'a'` and `'b'` respectively.

If the 0th character in `s` is `'a'`, then `dp[0][1] = 1`. Otherwise, `dp[0][0] = 1`.

For `1 <= i < n`, there is `dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0]` and `dp[i][1] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1])`, without checking the `i`-th character in `s`. If the `i`-th character in `s` is `'a'`, then add 1 to `dp[i][1]`. Otherwise, add 1 to `dp[i][0]`. Finally, return the minimum of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 1][1]`.
