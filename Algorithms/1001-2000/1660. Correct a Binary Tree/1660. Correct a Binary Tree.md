# 1660. Correct a Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
You have a binary tree with a small defect. There is **exactly one** invalid node where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the **same depth** but to the **invalid node's right**.

Given the root of the binary tree with this defect, `root`, return *the root of the binary tree after **removing** this invalid node **and every node underneath it** (minus the node it incorrectly points to)*.

**Custom testing:**

The test input is read as 3 lines:

* `TreeNode root`
* `int fromNode` (**not available to** `correctBinaryTree`)
* `int toNode` (**not available to** `correctBinaryTree`)

After the binary tree rooted at `root` is parsed, the `TreeNode` with value of `fromNode` will have its right child pointer pointing to the `TreeNode` with a value of `toNode`. Then, `root` is passed to `correctBinaryTree`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3], fromNode = 2, toNode = 3

**Output:** [1,null,3]

**Explanation:** The node with value 2 is invalid, so remove it.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/22/ex2v3.png)

**Input:** root = [8,3,1,7,null,9,4,2,null,null,null,5,6], fromNode = 7, toNode = 4

**Output:** [8,3,1,null,null,9,4,null,null,5,6]

**Explanation:** The node with value 7 is invalid, so remove it and the node underneath it, node 2.

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[3, 10^4]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `fromNode != toNode`
* `fromNode` and `toNode` will exist in the tree and will be on the same depth.
* `toNode` is to the **right** of `fromNode`.
* `fromNode.right` is `null` in the initial tree from the test data.

## Solution
Use a map to store each node's parent node. Do level order traversal on the binary tree. Each time visit all nodes in the same level. If there exists a node's right child that has already been visited, then the current node is an invalid node. Obtain the invalid node's parent node, and remove the subtree of the invalid node by setting the parent node's corresponding child to `null`. Finally, return `root`.
