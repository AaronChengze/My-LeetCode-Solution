# 1666. Change the Root of a Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree and a `leaf` node, reroot the tree so that the `leaf` is the new root.

You can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node `cur` on the path **starting from the** `leaf` up to the `root` excluding the root:

1. If `cur` has a left child, then that child becomes `cur`'s right child. Note that it is guaranteed that `cur` will have at most one child.
2. `cur`'s original parent becomes `cur`'s left child.

Return *the new root of the rerooted tree*.

**Note:** Ensure that your solution sets the `Node.parent` pointers correctly after rerooting or you will receive "Wrong Answer".

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 7

**Output:** [7,2,null,5,4,3,6,null,null,null,1,null,null,0,8]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 0

**Output:** [0,1,null,3,8,5,null,null,null,6,2,null,null,7,4]

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `leaf` exists in the tree.

## Solution
Let `node = leaf` and do operations on `node`. Before the operations, update `leaf`'s left child, right child and parent accordingly.

Each time, `node.left` is the original parent of `node`. Update the original parent's left child and right child accordingly.

When the root is reached, which means `node.left == root`, update the root's left child and right child accordingly.

Finally, return `leaf`.
