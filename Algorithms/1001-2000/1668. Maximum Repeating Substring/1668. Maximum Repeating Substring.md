# 1668. Maximum Repeating Substring
## Level
Easy

## Description
For a string `sequence`, a string `word` is **`k`-repeating** if `word` concatenated `k` times is a substring of `sequence`. The `word`'s **maximum `k`-repeating value** is the highest value `k` where `word` is `k`-repeating in `sequence`. If `word` is not a substring of `sequence`, `word`'s maximum `k`-repeating value is `0`.

Given strings `sequence` and `word`, return *the **maximum `k`-repeating value** of `word` in `sequence`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** "abab" is a substring in "ababc".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** "ba" is a substring in "ababc". "baba" is not a substring in "ababc".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** "ac" is not a substring in "ababc". 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= sequence.length <= 100`
* `1 <= word.length <= 100`
* `sequence` and `word` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Repeat `word` for several times and check whether the repeated string is a substring of `sequence`. If `word` is repeated `k` times and is a substring of `sequence`, then update the maximum repeating times with `k`. Finally, return the maximum repeating times.
