# 1676. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree IV
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an array of `TreeNode` objects `nodes`, return *the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of **all the nodes** in `nodes`*. All the nodes will exist in the tree, and all values of the tree's nodes are **unique**.

Extending the **[definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)**: "The lowest common ancestor of `n` nodes `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_n` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has every `p_i` as a **descendant** (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**) for every valid `i`". A **descendant** of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [4,7]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The lowest common ancestor of nodes 4 and 7 is node 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The lowest common ancestor of a single node is the node itself.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [7,6,2,4]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The lowest common ancestor of the nodes 7, 6, 2, and 4 is node 5.

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], nodes = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 3
Explanation: The lowest common ancestor of all the nodes is the root node.

Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are unique.
* All `nodes[i]` will exist in the tree.
* All `nodes[i]` are distinct.

## Solution
Use depth first search. For each node, if it is in `nodes`, then the node is the lowest common ancestor in its subtree. Otherwise, check the node's two children. If both subtrees contain nodes in `nodes`, then the current node is the lowest common ancestor in its subtree. If either subtree contains nodes in `nodes`, then the corresponding child is the lowest common ancestor in the current node's subtree. Otherwise, return `null`, which indicates the current subtree does not contain any node in `nodes`. Finally, return the lowest common ancestor of all nodes in `nodes`.
