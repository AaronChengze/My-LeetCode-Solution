# 1680. Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return *the **decimal value** of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of `1` to `n` in order, **modulo** `10^9 + 7`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** "1" in binary corresponds to the decimal value 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** 27

**Explanation:** In binary, 1, 2, and 3 corresponds to "1", "10", and "11".

After concatenating them, we have "11011", which corresponds to the decimal value 27.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 12

**Output:** 505379714

**Explanation:** The concatenation results in "1101110010111011110001001101010111100".

The decimal value of that is 118505380540.

After modulo 10^9 + 7, the result is 505379714.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`

## Solution
Initialize `bits = 0` and `num = 0`. Loop over `i` from 1 to `n`. For any `i`, if there is `(i & (i - 1)) == 0` (e.g., `i` is 1, 2, 4, etc.), then `bits` is increased by 1. For example, consider the following cases.
- When `i` becomes 1, then `bits` becomes 1.
- When `i` becomes 2, then `bits` becomes 2.
- When `i` becomes 4, then `bits` becomes 3.

For each `i`, after `bits` is updated, set `num = (num << bits) + i` and do modulo operation on `num`. Finally, return `num`.
