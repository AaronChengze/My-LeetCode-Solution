# 1685. Sum of Absolute Differences in a Sorted Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

Build and return *an integer array `result` with the same length as `nums` such that `result[i]` is equal to the **summation of absolute differences** between `nums[i]` and all the other elements in the array*.

In other words, `result[i]` is equal to `sum(|nums[i]-nums[j]|)` where `0 <= j < nums.length` and `j != i` (**0-indexed**).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,5]

**Output:** [4,3,5]

**Explanation:** Assuming the arrays are 0-indexed, then

result[0] = |2-2| + |2-3| + |2-5| = 0 + 1 + 3 = 4,

result[1] = |3-2| + |3-3| + |3-5| = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3,

result[2] = |5-2| + |5-3| + |5-5| = 3 + 2 + 0 = 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,6,8,10]

**Output:** [24,15,13,15,21]

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] <= 10^4`

## Solution
Let `n` be the length of `nums`. Create two arrays `leftDifferences` and `rightDifferences` that both have length `n`. Calculate `leftDifferences[0]` as the sum of absolute differences between `nums[0]` and all the other elements in `nums`. For `i` from 1 to `n - 1`, let `difference = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]` and calculate `leftDifferences[i] = leftDifferences[i - 1] - difference - difference * (n - 1 - i)`. Calculate `rightDifferences[n - 1]` as the sum of absolute differences between `nums[n - 1]` and all the other elements in `nums`. For `i` from `n - 2` to 0, let `difference = nums[i + 1] - nums[i]` and calculate `rightDifferences[i] = rightDifferences[i + 1] - difference - difference * i`. For the array `result`, there is `result[i] = leftDifferences[i] + rightDifferences[i]` for all `0 <= i < n`. Finally, return `result`.
