# 1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers
## Level
Medium

## Description
A decimal number is called **deci-binary** if each of its digits is either `0` or `1` without any leading zeros. For example, `101` and `1100` are **deci-binary**, while `112` and `3001` are not.

Given a string `n` that represents a positive decimal integer, return *the **minimum** number of positive **deci-binary** numbers needed so that they sum up to `n`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = "32"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** 10 + 11 + 11 = 32

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = "82734"

**Output:** 8

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = "27346209830709182346"

**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
* `n` consists of only digits.
* `n` does not contain any leading zeros and represents a positive integer.

## Solution
Each digit in `n` must be represented by several 1's to sum up to the digit int `n`. Therefore, loop over all digits in `n` and obtain the maximum digit. Suppose the maximum digit is `x`, then the minimum number of deci-binary numbers is `x`.

Obviously, it is impossible to partition `n` into `y` deci-binary numbers where `y < x`. Also, it is possible to partition `n` into `x` deci-binary numbers.
