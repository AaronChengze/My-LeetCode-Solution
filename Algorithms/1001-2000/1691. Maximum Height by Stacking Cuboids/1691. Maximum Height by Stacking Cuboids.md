# 1691. Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given `n` `cuboids` where the dimensions of the `i-th` cuboid is `cuboids[i] = [width_i, length_i, height_i]` (**0-indexed**). Choose a **subset** of `cuboids` and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid `i` on cuboid `j` if `width_i <= width_j` and `length_i <= length_j` and `height_i <= height_j`. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.

Return *the **maximum height** of the stacked `cuboids`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]

**Output:** 190

**Explanation:**

Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.

Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.

Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.

The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cuboids = [[38,25,45],[76,35,3]]

**Output:** 76

**Explanation:**

You can't place any of the cuboids on the other.

We choose cuboid 1 and rotate it so that the 35x3 side is facing down and its height is 76.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cuboids = [[7,11,17],[7,17,11],[11,7,17],[11,17,7],[17,7,11],[17,11,7]]

**Output:** 102

**Explanation:**

After rearranging the cuboids, you can see that all cuboids have the same dimension.

You can place the 11x7 side down on all cuboids so their heights are 17.

The maximum height of stacked cuboids is 6 * 17 = 102.

**Constraints:**

* `n == cuboids.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= width_i, length_i, height_i <= 100`

## Solution
First, rearrange all the cuboids such that for any `cuboids[i]`, there is `cuboids[i][0] <= cuboids[i][1] <= cuboids[i][2]`. Then sort all the cuboids according to their widths, lengths and heights.

For any two cuboids `cuboids[j]` and `cuboids[i]` where `0 <= j < i < n`, `cuboids[j]` can be placed on `cuboids[i]` if and only if `cuboids[j][0] <= cuboids[i][0]` and `cuboids[j][1] <= cuboids[i][1]` and `cuboids[j][2] <= cuboids[i][2]`. If this is not the case, then `cuboids[j]` cannot be placed on `cuboids[i]` even if the two cubiods are rearranged.

After all the cuboids are rearranged and sorted, use dynamic programming to find the maximum height. Create an array `dp` of length `n` such that `dp[i]` represents the maximum height when `cuboids[i]` is used. Initially, `dp[i] = cuboids[i][2]` for all `0 <= i < n`. For each cuboid, always use the last dimention since it is the dimension with the maximum value in the cuboid. For each `1 <= i < n`, loop over `0 <= j < i`. If `cuboids[j]` can be placed on `cuboids[i]`, then update `dp[i]` using `dp[j] + cuboids[i][2]`.

In the dynamic programming process, maintain the maximum height. Finally, return the maximum height.
