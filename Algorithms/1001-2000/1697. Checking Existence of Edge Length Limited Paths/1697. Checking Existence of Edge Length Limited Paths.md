# 1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths
## Level
Hard

## Description
An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where `edgeList[i] = [u_i, v_i, dis_i]` denotes an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` with distance `dis_i`. Note that there may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.

Given an array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [p_j, q_j, limit_j]`, your task is to determine for each `queries[j]` whether there is a path between `p_j` and `q_j` such that each edge on the path has a distance **strictly less than** `limit_j`.

Return *a **boolean array** `answer`, where `answer.length == queries.length` and the `j-th` value of `answer` is `true` if there is a path for `queries[j]` is `true`, and `false` otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/08/h.png)

**Input:** n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]

**Output:** [false,true]

**Explanation:** The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.

For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.

For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/08/q.png)

**Input:** n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1,10],[1,2,5],[2,3,9],[3,4,13]], queries = [[0,4,14],[1,4,13]]

**Output:** [true,false]

**Exaplanation:** The above figure shows the given graph.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 10^5`
* `edgeList[i].length == 3`
* `queries[j].length == 3`
* `0 <= u_i, v_i, p_j, q_j <= n - 1`
* `u_i != v_i`
* `p_j != q_j`
* `1 <= dis_i, limit_j <= 10^9`
* There may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.

## Solution
Create an array that stores the indices of `queries`, and sort the array according to `queries`' limits in ascending order. Sort `edgeList` according to distances in ascending order.

Then use union find. For each query, loop over sorted `edgeList`, and for the edges that have distances less than the current query's limit, union the edges' nodes. After the union operation, use the find operation to check whether the two nodes are in the same component, which is the query result. Then store the query result at the corresponding index of the array of the query results.

Finally, return the array of the query results.
