# 1698. Number of Distinct Substrings in a String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string `s`, return *the number of **distinct** substrings of `s`*.

A **substring** of a string is obtained by deleting any number of characters (possibly zero) from the front of the string and any number (possibly zero) from the back of the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aabbaba"

**Output:** 21

**Explanation:** The set of distinct strings is ["a","b","aa","bb","ab","ba","aab","abb","bba","aba","aabb","abba","bbab","baba","aabba","abbab","bbaba","aabbab","abbaba","aabbaba"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abcdefg"

**Output:** 28

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Let `n` be the length of string `s`. Create an array `dp` of length `n`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of distinct substrings for the first `i + 1` characters of `s`. Initially, `dp[0] = 1`. Use an array `exists` to store whether each letter exists.

Loop over `s` from index 1 to index `n - 1`. For each index `i`, if the letter at index `i` does not exist in the indices range `[0, i - 1]`, then the `i + 1` substrings that end at index `i` are all distinct from the previous substrings, so `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i + 1`, and set the corresponding value in `exists` to `true`. Otherwise, find the largest index `j` such that `s.substring(j, i + 1)` does not exist in the prefix, which means all substrings that end at `index` and have start indices in the range `[0, j]` are all distinct from the previous substrings, so `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + j + 1`.

Finally, return `dp[n - 1]`.
