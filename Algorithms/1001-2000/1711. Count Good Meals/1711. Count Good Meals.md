# 1711. Count Good Meals
## Level
Medium

## Description
A **good meal** is a meal that contains **exactly two different food items** with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick **any** two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the `i-th` item of food, return *the number of different **good meals** you can make from this list modulo `10^9 + 7`*.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:** The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= deliciousness.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 2^20`

## Solution
Use a map to store each deliciousness' number of occurrences and maintain the maximum deliciousness. Loop over `deliciousness`. For each element, obtain all the elements that are greater than or equal to the current element such that the sum of the current element and the other element is a power of two, and update the number of good meals. Finally, return the number of good meals.
