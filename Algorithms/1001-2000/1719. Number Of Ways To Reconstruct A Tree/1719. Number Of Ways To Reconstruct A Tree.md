# 1719. Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an array pairs, where `pairs[i] = [x_i, y_i]`, and:

* There are no duplicates.
* `x_i < y_i`

Let `ways` be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:

* The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in `pairs`.
* A pair `[x_i, y_i]` exists in pairs if and only if `x_i` is an ancestor of `y_i` or `y_i` is an ancestor of `x_i`.
* **Note:** the tree does not have to be a binary tree.

Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.

Return:

* `0` if `ways == 0`
* `1` if `ways == 1`
* `2` if `ways > 1`

A **rooted tree** is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.

An **ancestor** of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** There is exactly one valid rooted tree, which is shown in the above figure.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are multiple valid rooted trees. Three of them are shown in the above figures.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[1,5]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There are no valid rooted trees.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= pairs.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= x_i < y_i <= 500`
* The elements in `pairs` are unique.

## Solution
Loop over `pairs`. Use a 2D matrix to store whether two nodes have a relation of pairs. Use an array of lists to store the related nodes of each node. Then sort the array of lists according to the lists' sizes in ascending order. Node `i` is an ancestor of node `j` if and only if the size of node `i` is greater than or equal to the size of node `j`. If the sizes are equal, then the two nodes can be swapped. Use this way to determine the final result.
