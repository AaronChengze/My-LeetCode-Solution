# 1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the `i-th` job.

There are `k` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is **minimized**.

*Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment.*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** jobs = [1,2,4,7,8], k = 2

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:** Assign the jobs the following way:

Worker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)

Worker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)

The maximum working time is 11.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`
* `1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming with compressed states. Let `n` be the length of `jobs`. Create a 2D array `dp` with `k + 1` rows and `1 << n` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum time required starting from job `i` and mask `j`.

Initialize `dp[k][(1 << n) - 1] = 0`. Then for `i` from `k - 1` to 0 and for `mask` from `(1 << length) - 2` to 0, loop over all possible values `curr` from 1 to `(1 << length) - 1`. If `(curr & mask) == 0`, then update `dp[i][mask]` accordingly.

Finally, return `dp[0][0]`.
