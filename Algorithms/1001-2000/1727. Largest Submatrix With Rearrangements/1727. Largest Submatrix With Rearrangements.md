# 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and you are allowed to rearrange the **columns** of the `matrix` in any order.

Return *the area of the largest submatrix within `matrix` where **every** element of the submatrix is `1` after reordering the columns optimally*.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/29/screenshot-2020-12-30-at-40536-pm.png)

**Input:** matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** You can rearrange the columns as shown above.

The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/29/screenshot-2020-12-30-at-40852-pm.png)

**Input:** matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** You can rearrange the columns as shown above.

The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** matrix = [[0,0],[0,0]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** As there are no 1s, no submatrix of 1s can be formed and the area is 0.

**Constraints:**

* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
* `matrix[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution
For each element in `matrix`, calculate the number of consecutive 1's above the element. Concretely, if `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then find the minimum `k` such that for all `k <= p <= i`, there is `matrix[p][j] == 1`. Create `newMatrix` with the same size as `matrix`, and set `newMatrix[i][j] = i - k + 1` where `k` is defined above.

Then for each row `curRow` in `newMatrix`, sort `curRow` and loop over `curRow` backwards. For `curRow[j]`, the current area is calculated as `(n - j) * curRow[j]`. Maintain the maximum area in the process.

Finally, return the maximum area.
