# 1734. Decode XORed Permutation
## Level
Medium

## Description
There is an integer array `perm` that is a permutation of the first `n` positive integers, where `n` is always **odd**.

It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, such that `encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]`. For example, if `perm = [1,3,2]`, then `encoded = [2,1]`.

Given the `encoded` array, return *the original array `perm`*. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** encoded = [3,1]

**Output:** [1,2,3]

**Explanation:** If perm = [1,2,3], then encoded = [1 XOR 2,2 XOR 3] = [3,1]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** encoded = [6,5,4,6]

**Output:** [2,4,1,5,3]

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= n < 10^5`
* `n` is odd.
* `encoded.length == n - 1`

## Solution
Use the condition that `n` is odd to solve this problem. First calculate `totalXOR` as the XOR from 1 to `n`. Next, calculate the XOR result of even indices of `encoded` as `evenXOR`, and the XOR result of odd indices of `encoded` as `oddXOR`. Then there is `decoded[0] = totalXOR ^ oddXOR` and `decoded[n - 1] = totalXOR ^ evenXOR`. Finally, for `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, there is `decoded[i + 1] = decoded[i] ^ encoded[i]`.
