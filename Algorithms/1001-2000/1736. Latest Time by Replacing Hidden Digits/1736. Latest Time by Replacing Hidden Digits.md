# 1736. Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a string `time` in the form of `hh:mm`, where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by `?`).

The valid times are those inclusively between `00:00` and `23:59`.

Return *the latest valid time you can get from `time` by replacing the hidden digits*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** time = "2?:?0"

**Output:** "23:50"

**Explanation:** The latest hour beginning with the digit '2' is 23 and the latest minute ending with the digit '0' is 50.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** time = "0?:3?"

**Output:** "09:39"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** time = "1?:22"

**Output:** "19:22"

**Constraints:**

* `time` is in the format `hh:mm`.
* It is guaranteed that you can produce a valid time from the given string.

## Solution
First consider the hour. The hour must be in range [00, 23]. Replace the hidden digits with the maximum possible value in the range. Then consider the minute. The minute must be in range [00, 59]. The two digits of the minute should be replaced with the maximum possible digit, which are 5 and 9 respectively. Finally, return the replaced time.
