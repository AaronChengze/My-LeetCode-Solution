# 1739. Building Boxes
## Level
Hard

## Description
You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to `n` units. You are asked to place `n` boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:

* You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
* If box `x` is placed on top of the box `y`, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box `y` **must** either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.

Given an integer `n`, return *the **minimum** possible number of boxes touching the floor*.

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.

These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/4-boxes.png)

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/10-boxes.png)

**Input:** n = 10

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.

These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the back side.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^9`

## Solution
The ideal situation is that the `i`-th level from the top (where `i` starts from 1) contains `i * (i + 1) / 2` boxes. Calculate the minimum number of boxes under the ideal situation such that the number of boxes is at least `n`. After that, calculate the remaining boxes at the bottom level where the number of boxes is exactly `n`. Let `remain` be the number of remaining boxes. Find the minimum possible value `min` such that `min * (min + 1) / 2 >= remain`. Let `currLevel` be the number of boxes in the last level just above the bottom level. The result is `currLevel + min`.
