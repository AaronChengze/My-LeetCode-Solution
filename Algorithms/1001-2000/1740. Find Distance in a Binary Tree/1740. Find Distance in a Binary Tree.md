# 1740. Find Distance in a Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree and two integers `p` and `q`, return *the **distance** between the nodes of value `p` and value `q` in the tree*.

The **distance** between two nodes is the number of edges on the path from one to the other.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 0

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** There are 3 edges between 5 and 0: 5-3-1-0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 7

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are 2 edges between 5 and 7: 5-2-7.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 5

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** The distance between a node and itself is 0.

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are unique.
* `p` and `q` are values in the tree.

## Solution
First, find the lowest common ancestor of the two nodes with values `p` and `q`. Next, calculate the distances from the lowest common ancestor to the two nodes with values `p` and `q`, respectively. Finally, calculate the sum of the two distances and return.
