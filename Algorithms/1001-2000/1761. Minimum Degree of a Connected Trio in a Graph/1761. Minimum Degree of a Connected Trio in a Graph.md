# 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `u_i` and `v_i`.

A **connected trio** is a set of **three** nodes where there is an edge between **every** pair of them.

The **degree of a connected trio** is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.

Return *the **minimum** degree of a connected trio in the graph, or `-1` if the graph has no connected trios*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** There is exactly one trio, which is [1,2,3]. The edges that form its degree are bolded in the figure above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[1,3],[4,1],[4,3],[2,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,5],[2,6]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There are exactly three trios:

1) [1,4,3] with degree 0.

2) [2,5,6] with degree 2.

3) [5,6,7] with degree 2.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 400`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1) / 2`
* `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
* `u_i != v_i`
* There are no repeated edges.

## Solution
Use a hash map to store each node's connected nodes. Then loop over all tuples of nodes and determine whether the three nodes form a connected trio. If the three nodes form a connected trio, calculate the sum of the numbers of edges that connect to the three nodes and subtract 6 from the sum (to exclude the edges inside the trio). During the process, maintain the minimum degree. Finally, return the minimum degree.
