# 1002. Find Common Characters
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array `A` of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list **(including duplicates)**. For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["bella","label","roller"]

**Output:** ["e","l","l"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["cool","lock","cook"]

**Output:** ["c","o"]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`
3. `A[i][j]` is a lowercase letter

## Solution
Loop over all strings in `A`. For each letter, store the minimum number of occurrences among all the strings. Then for each letter that occurs in all strings, add the letter to the result list, considering duplicates. Finally, return the result list.
