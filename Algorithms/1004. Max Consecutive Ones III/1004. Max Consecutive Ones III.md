# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

[1,1,1,0,0,++**1**++,++1++,++1++,++1++,++1++,++**1**++]

Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

[0,0,++1++,++1++,++**1**++,++**1**++,++1++,++1++,++1++,++**1**++,++1++,++1++,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]

Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
2. `0 <= K <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is `0` or `1`

## Solution
Loop over the array and store the start index of the subarray and the number of zeros in the subarray.

Initially, the start index `start` is 0, and the number of zeros `zerosCount` is 0. For each index `i` from 0 to `A.length - 1`, if `A[i] == 0`, then increase `zerosCount` by 1. As long as `zerosCount <= K`, all zeros met so far can be changed to ones. If at one step `zerosCount > K`, then move `start` forward until the number of zeros in the subarray (from index `start` to index `i`) is not more than `K`. At each index `i`, update the max consecutive ones using `i - start + 1`. Finally, return the max consecutive ones.
