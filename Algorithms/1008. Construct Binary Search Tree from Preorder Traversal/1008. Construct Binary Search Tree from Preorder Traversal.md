# 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal
## Level
Medium

## Description
Return the root node of a binary **search** tree that matches the given preorder traversal.

*(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of `node.left` has a value `< node.val`, and any descendant of `node.right` has a value `> node.val`. Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the `node` first, then traverses `node.left`, then traverses `node.right`.)*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [8,5,1,7,10,12]

**Output:** [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= preorder.length <= 100`
2. The values of `preorder` are distinct.

## Solution
The solution to problem 105 can be reused here. For a binary search tree, the inorder traversal has all elements sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the inorder traversal can be determined. Use the preorder traversal and the inorder traversal to construct the binary tree, which is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.
