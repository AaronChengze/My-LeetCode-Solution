# 1016. Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary string `S` (a string consisting only of '0' and '1's) and a positive integer `N`, return true if and only if for every integer X from 1 to N, the binary representation of X is a substring of S.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "0110", N = 3

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** S = "0110", N = 4

**Output:** false

**Note:**

1. `1 <= S.length <= 1000`
2. `1 <= N <= 10^9`

## Solution
For a positive integer, it has at most 31 bits (the highest bit must be 0, so ignore the highest bit). Therefore, for each character in `S`, use it as the highest bit of a binary number, and obtain all possible numbers that have at most 31 bits. Use a set to store all such possible numbers.

Then for each positive integer from 1 to `N`, check whether the positive integer is in the set. If there exists a positive integer that is not in the set, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.
