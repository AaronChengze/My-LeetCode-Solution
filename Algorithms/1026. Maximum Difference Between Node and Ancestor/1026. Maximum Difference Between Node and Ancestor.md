# 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `V` for which there exists **different** nodes `A` and `B` where `V = |A.val - B.val|` and `A` is an ancestor of `B`.

(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

**Input:** [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation: **

We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below:

|8 - 3| = 5

|3 - 7| = 4

|8 - 1| = 7

|10 - 13| = 3

Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the tree is between `2` and `5000`.
2. Each node will have value between `0` and `100000`.

## Solution
Use a map to store the minimum value and the maximum value in each subtree. First, do breadth first search to obtain all the nodes and the values. Next, loop over the nodes in the reversing order, and for each node, obtain its children and calculate the maximum difference between the node and the children's minimum values and maximum values. After that, update the current node's minimum value and maximum value using its children's minimum values and maximum values. Repeat the process until all the nodes are visited. Finally, return the maximum difference.
