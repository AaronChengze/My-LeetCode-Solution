# 1037. Valid Boomerang
## Level
Easy

## Description
A *boomerang* is a set of 3 points that are all distinct and **not** in a straight line.

Given a list of three points in the plane, return whether these points are a boomerang.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]

**Output:** false

**Note:**

1. `points.length == 3`
2. `points[i].length == 2`
3. `0 <= points[i][j] <= 100`

## Solution
For the 3 points given, calculate the lines of the 2 pairs of adjacent points. Suppose the lines are `(difX1, difY1)` and `(difX2, difY2)` respectively.

The 3 points are not in a straight line if and only if `difY1 / difX1 != difY2 / difX2`, which is equivalent to `difX1 * difY2 != difX2 * difY1`. So return `true` if and only if `difX1 * difY2 != difX2 * difY1`.
