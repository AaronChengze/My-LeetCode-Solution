# 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the root of a binary **search** tree with distinct values, modify it so that every `node` has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to `node.val`.

As a reminder, a *binary search tree* is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]

**Output:** [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `100`.
2. Each node will have value between `0` and `100`.
3. The given tree is a binary search tree.

## Solution
Since the inorder traversal of a binary search tree contains all the elements sorted, the idea of inorder traversal can be used to solve this problem. Use the idea of the solution to problem 94.

Do inorder traversal on the binary search tree such that the right subtree is visited before the left subtree. In this way, the elements in the binary search tree are visited in descending order.

Actually it is not necessary to obtain the inorder traversal sequence. Each time a node is visited, simply add its previous node's value to the current node's value. Here "previons node" means the node that was visited just before the current node.

Finally, return the root.
