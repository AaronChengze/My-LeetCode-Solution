# 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given `N`, consider a convex `N`-sided polygon with vertices labelled `A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1]` in clockwise order.

Suppose you triangulate the polygon into `N-2` triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the **product** of the labels of the vertices, and the *total score* of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `N-2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,2,3]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,7,4,5]

**Output:** 144

**Explanation:** There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1,3,1,4,1,5]

**Output**: 13

**Explanation:** The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.

**Note:**

1. `3 <= A.length <= 50`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 100`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `A.length` rows and `A.length` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the smallest possible total score from vertex at index `i` to vertex at index `j`.

If there are three vertices with indices `i`, `k` and `j` (it is possible that `i > k` or `k > j`), then the distance between `i` and `j` is at least 2. Therefore, for each distance from 2 to `A.length - 1`, let `i` be the start index and let `j` be the end index, and for each `k` such that `i < k < j`, calculate `dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + A[i] * A[k] * A[j]`, and update `dp[i][j]` with the smallest possible value.

Finally, return `dp[0][A.length - 1]`.
