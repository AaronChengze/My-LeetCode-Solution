# 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent
## Level
Easy

## Description
You have `N` gardens, labelled `1` to `N`. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

`paths[i] = [x, y]` describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden `x` to garden `y`.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return **any** such a choice as an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the `(i+1)`-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]

**Output:** [1,2,3]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]

**Output:** [1,2,1,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]

**Output:** [1,2,3,4]

**Note:**

* `1 <= N <= 10000`
* `0 <= paths.size <= 20000`
* No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
* It is guaranteed an answer exists.

## Solution
Use a map to store each garden and its adjacent gardens.

Initially, plant flower type 1 in garden 1. For the other gardens, find a flower type that hasn't been planted in any of its adjacent gardens, and plant the flower type in the garden.
