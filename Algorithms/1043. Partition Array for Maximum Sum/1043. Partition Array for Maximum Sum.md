# 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer array `A`, you partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most `K`. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], K = 3

**Output:** 84

**Explanation:** A becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= K <= A.length <= 500`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create an array `dp` of length `A.length + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the largest sum of the first `i` elements of `A` after partitioning. Obviously, `dp[0] = 0`. The target is to calculate `dp[A.length]`.

For `i` from 1 to `A.length`, where `i - 1` is the last index of the last subarray, let `j` be the first index of the last subarray, then there is `i - j <= K` and `j >= 0`. For each such `j`, obtain the maximum element from `A[j]` to `A[i - 1]` as `max`, and calculate `dp[i]` as the greatest possible value of `dp[j] + max * (i - j)`.

Finally, return `dp[A.length]`.
