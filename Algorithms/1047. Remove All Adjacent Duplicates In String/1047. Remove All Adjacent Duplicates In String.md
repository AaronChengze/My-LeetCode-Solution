# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `S` of lowercase letters, a *duplicate removal* consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "abbaca"

**Output:** "ca"

**Explanation:**

For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

**Note:**

1. `1 <= S.length <= 20000`
2. `S` consists only of English lowercase letters.

## Solution
Use a stack to store characters. Loop over the string `S` from right to left. If the stack is empty or the current character doesn't equal the character at the top of the stack, push the current character into the stack. If the current character equals the character at the top of the stack, then there are two adjacent and equal characters, so pop the character at the top of the stack. Continue the process until the whole string is looped over.

Then push all the characters from the stack and append them to the result string. Finally, return the result string.
