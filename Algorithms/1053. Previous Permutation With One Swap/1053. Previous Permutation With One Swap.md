# 1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `A` of positive integers (not necessarily distinct), return the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than `A`, that can be **made with one swap** (A *swap* exchanges the positions of two numbers `A[i]` and `A[j]`). If it cannot be done, then return the same array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,2,1]

**Output:** [3,1,2]

**Explanation:** Swapping 2 and 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,1,5]

**Output:** [1,1,5]

**Explanation:** This is already the smallest permutation.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1,9,4,6,7]

**Output:** [1,7,4,6,9]

**Explanation:** Swapping 9 and 7.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** [3,1,1,3]

**Output:** [1,3,1,3]

**Explanation:** Swapping 1 and 3.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 10000`

## Solution
Loop over the array `A` from right to left and find the rightmost occurrence of reversing order of two adjacent elements. If elements in reversing order are not found, then return the same array.

The left element in the reversing order is the element to be swapped. Find the maximum element that is less than the element to be swapped, and swap the two elements.
