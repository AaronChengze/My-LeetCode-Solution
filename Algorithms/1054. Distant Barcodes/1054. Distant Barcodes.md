# 1054. Distant Barcodes
## Level
Medium

## Description
In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the `i`-th barcode is `barcodes[i]`.

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal.  You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,1,1,2,2,2]

**Output:** [2,1,2,1,2,1]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]

**Output:** [1,3,1,3,2,1,2,1]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000`

## Solution
Since the maximum number is at most 10000, the range of the numbers can be determined. Count the number of occurrences of each number in `barcodes`. Maintain an even index that is initially 0 and an odd index that is initially 1. If the array's length is odd and there is a number that occurs `barcodes.length / 2 + 1` times, then the number must be in all even indices. Otherwise, first consider putting the numbers in odd indices and then in even indices. Do this for each number. Since odd indices are not adjacent and even indices are not adjacent, it is guaranteed that the adjacent numbers are not the same. Finally, return the rearranged array.
