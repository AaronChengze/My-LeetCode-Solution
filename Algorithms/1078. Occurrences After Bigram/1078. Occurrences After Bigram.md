# 1078. Occurrences After Bigram
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given words `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some `text` of the form "`first second third`", where `second` comes immediately after `first`, and `third` comes immediately after `second`.

For each such occurrence, add "`third`" to the answer, and return the answer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"

**Output:** ["girl","student"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"

**Output:** ["we","rock"]

**Note:**

1. `1 <= text.length <= 1000`
2. `text` consists of space separated words, where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
3. `1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10`
4. `first` and `second` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Split `text` into an array of strings using spaces. Then loop over the array and check each pair of adjacent words. If "`first second`" occurs, then find `third` which comes immediately after `second`, and add `third` into the result array. Finally, return the result array.
