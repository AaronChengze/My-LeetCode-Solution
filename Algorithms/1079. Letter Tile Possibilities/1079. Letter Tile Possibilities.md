# 1079. Letter Tile Possibilities
## Level
Medium

## Description
You have a set of `tiles`, where each tile has one letter `tiles[i]` printed on it. Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "AAB"

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "AAABBC"

**Output:** 188

**Note:**

1. `1 <= tiles.length <= 7`
2. `tiles` consists of uppercase English letters.

## Solution
Since `tiles` has length at most 7, obtain all possible combinations of `tiles`. For each combination, obtain all possible permutations. Use the solution to problem 47 to obtain all possible permutations. Each permutation can generate a non-empty sequence of letters, which is represented as a string. Use a set to store all the sequences to avoid duplicates. Finally, return the set's size.
