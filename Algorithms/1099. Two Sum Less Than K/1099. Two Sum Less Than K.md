# 1099. Two Sum Less Than K
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array `A` of integers and integer `K`, return the maximum `S` such that there exists `i < j` with `A[i] + A[j] = S` and `S < K`. If no `i, j` exist satisfying this equation, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60

**Output:** 58

**Explanation: **

We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [10,20,30], K = 15

**Output:** -1

**Explanation: **

In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 1000`
3. `1 <= K <= 2000`

## Solution
Obviously, if the array contains only 0 or 1 number, it is impossible to find two numbers in the array, so return -1.

Sort the array, and calculate the sum of the two smallest elements. If the smallest sum is greater than `K`, then it is impossible to find two numbers with sum less than `K`, so return -1.

Use two pointers `low` and `high` that point to the start and the end of the array initially. Each time calculate the sum of the two numbers at the two pointers. If the sum is greater than or equal to `K`, move `high` to the left by 1 step. Otherwise, update the maximum sum less than `K`, and move `low` to the right by 1 step. Finally, return the maximum sum less than `K`.
