# 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.

Given the `label` of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that `label`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** label = 14

**Output:** [1,3,4,14]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** label = 26

**Output:** [1,2,6,10,26]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= label <= 10^6`

## Solution
If all levels in the binary tree are labelled from left to right, then for a node with label `val` where `val > 1`, its parent's label is `val / 2`.

Since the binary tree is labelled in zigzag order, the label of each node's parent needs to be recalculated.

Let the root be at level 0. For level *h*, the minimum label is 2<sup>*h*</sup> and the maximum label is 2<sup>*h*+1</sup>-1. Therefore, for a node at level `h` with label `val` where `val > 1`, its parent's label is `(int) Math.pow(2, h - 1) * 3 - 1 - val / 2`. Use this way to find each node's parent, until the root is met. Then return a list that contains the labels of all the nodes in the path.
