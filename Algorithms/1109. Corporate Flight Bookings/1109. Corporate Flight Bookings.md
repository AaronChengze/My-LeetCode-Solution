# 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings
## Level
Medium

## Description
There are `n` flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.

We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking `bookings[i] = [i, j, k]` means that we booked `k` seats from flights labeled `i` to `j` inclusive.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5

**Output:** [10,55,45,25,25]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= bookings.length <= 20000`
* `1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000`
* `1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000`

## Solution
Create an array `seats` of length `n` to store the number of seats booked on each flight.

A straightforward implementation is that for each `booking = [i, j, k]`, increase all the elements from indices `i` to `j` by `k`. However, this implementation is quite time-consuming, since for each `booking`, there are `j - i + 1` elements that need to be updated.

To obtain an implementation with less runtime, for each `booking = [i, j, k]`, only two elements need to be updated, and the updates are to increase the element at index `i` by `k` and decrease the element at index `j + 1` by `k` (the latter only needs to be done when `j` is not the last index).

Then for each index `i` such that `0 < i < n`, set `seats[i] += seats[i - 1]`. In this way, for index `i`, all the updates on elements from `seats[0]` to `seats[i]` are included in `seats[i]`.

Finally, return `seats`.
