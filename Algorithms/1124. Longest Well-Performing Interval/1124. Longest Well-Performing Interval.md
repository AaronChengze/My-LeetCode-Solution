# 1124. Longest Well-Performing Interval
## Level
Medium

## Description
We are given `hours`, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a *tiring day* if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than `8`.

A *well-performing interval* is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= hours.length <= 10000`
* `0 <= hours[i] <= 16`

## Solution
For each day, the score is 1 if it is a tiring day or -1 if it is a non-tiring day. Create an array `scores` of length `hours.length + 1` that stores prefix sums, where `scores[0] = 0` and `scores[i]` is the sum of all scores from day 0 to day `i - 1` for `i > 0`.

After the prefix sums are calculated, create a stack to store indices. For each index `i` from 0 to `hours.length`, if the stack is empty or `scores[stack.peek()] > scores[i]`, then push `i` into the stack. The stack stores indices where the elements are in descending order.

Then loop over `scores` from right to left. For each index `i`, if `scores[index] > scores[stack.peek()]`, then the subarray `hours[stack.peek()..index-1]` is a well-performing interval, so update the maximum interval length.

Finally, return the maximum interval length.
