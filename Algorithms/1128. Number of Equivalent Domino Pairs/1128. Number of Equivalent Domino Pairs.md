# 1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a list of `dominoes`, `dominoes[i] = [a, b]` is *equivalent* to `dominoes[j] = [c, d]` if and only if either (`a==c` and `b==d`), or (`a==d` and `b==c`) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` for which `0 <= i < j < dominoes.length`, and `dominoes[i]` is equivalent to `dominoes[j]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= dominoes.length <= 40000`
* `1 <= dominoes[i][j] <= 9`

## Solution
First, check each domino whether it should be rotated. If a domino's upper number is greater than its lower number, or for the current index `i`, there is `dominoes[i][0] > dominoes[i][1]`, then rotate the domino.

Next, sort `dominoes` according to the upper number and then the lower number.

After sorting, count the number of consecutive dominoes that are equivalent, and the number of indices pairs that the two dominoes at the two indices are equivalent can be calculated.
