# 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `arr` of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

* Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
* The values of `arr` correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree. *(Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)*
* The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node. It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= arr.length <= 40`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 15`
* It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than `2^31`).

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. First create a 2D array `maxValues` of `arr.length` rows and `arr.length` columns, where `masValues[i][j]` represents the maximum value in subarray `arr[i..j]` for `i <= j`. Then create a 2D array `dp` of `arr.length` rows and `arr.length` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost tree from leaf values of the subarray `arr[i..j]` for `i < j`. For each possible length `curLength` from 1 to `arr.length - 1`, for `i` from 0 to `arr.length - curLength - 1`, for `j` from `i` to `i + curLength - 1`, calculate the value `dp[i][i + curLength]` as the minimum value of `dp[i][j] + dp[j + 1][i + curLength] + maxValues[i][j] * maxValues[j + 1][i + curLength]`. Finally, return `dp[0][arr.length - 1]`.
