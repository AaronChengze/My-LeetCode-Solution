# 1135. Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost
## Level
Medium

## Description
There are `N` cities numbered from 1 to `N`.

You are given `connections`, where each `connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost]` represents the cost to connect `city1` and `city2` together. (A *connection* is bidirectional: connecting `city1` and `city2` is the same as connecting `city2` and `city1`.)

Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.  The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= N <= 10000`
2. `1 <= connections.length <= 10000`
3. `1 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= N`
4. `0 <= connections[i][2] <= 10^5`
5. `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`

## Solution
This problem is a minimum spanning tree problem. Two algorithms exist for finding a minimum spanning tree, Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.

This solution uses Kruskal's algorithm. Sort `connections` according to the costs in ascending order. Each time select a `connection` that has the minimum cost. If the two cities are already in the same connected component, then skip the `connection`. Otherwise, add the cost to the total cost, and assign the two cities to the same conponent.

If there exists a minimium spanning tree, then the number of selected edges should be `N - 1`. In this case, return the total cost. If the number of selected edges is less than `N - 1`, then the original graph is not a connected graph and there doesn't exist a minimum spanning tree, so return -1.
