# 1138. Alphabet Board Path
## Level
Medium

## Description
On an alphabet board, we start at position `(0, 0)`, corresponding to character `board[0][0]`.

Here, `board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"]`, as shown in the diagram below.

We may make the following moves:

* `'U'` moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;
* `'D'` moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;
* `'L'` moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;
* `'R'` moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;
* `'!'` adds the character `board[r][c]` at our current position `(r, c)` to the answer.

(Here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)

Return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to `target` in the minimum number of moves. You may return any path that does so.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** target = "leet"

**Output:** "DDR!UURRR!!DDD!"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** target = "code"

**Output:** "RR!DDRR!UUL!R!"

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= target.length <= 100`
* `target` consists only of English lowercase letters.

## Solution
Obtain all letters' positions. For each pair of adjacent letters, obtain the path by the difference between the two positions' rows and the difference between the two positions' columns. When each letter is to be typed, add the path from the previous position to the current position to the sequence, and add `'!'` to the sequence.

If the current letter or the previous letter is `z`, then the path needs to be obtained differently. Since `z` is only letter in the last row, it is impossible to move left in the last row to reach `z`, and it is also impossible to move right in the last row from `z`. Therefore, to move to `z`, first move left to the leftmost column then move down. To move from `z`, first move up then move right (if the next letter is not in the leftmost column).

Finally, return the sequence.
