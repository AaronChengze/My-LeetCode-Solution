# 1139. Largest 1-Bordered Square
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a 2D `grid` of `0`s and `1`s, return the number of elements in the largest **square** subgrid that has all `1`s on its **border**, or `0` if such a subgrid doesn't exist in the `grid`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

**Output:** 9

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,0,0]]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= grid.length <= 100`
* `1 <= grid[0].length <= 100`
* `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`

## Solution
Initialize the maximum side of the square to 0. Suppose `grid` has `n` rows and `m` columns. For each `i` from 0 to `n - 1` and for each `j` from 0 to `m - 1`, let `(i, j)` be the top-left corner of the square subgrid, and find the largest square subgrid that has all 1s on its border. If `grid[i][j]` is 0, then move to the next cell. If `grid[i][j]` is 1, then update the maximum side of the square to 1 if it is 0, and find the current maximum possible side length as `curMaxSide = Math.min(n - i, m - j)`. For `k` from 1 to `curMaxSide - 1`, first check whether the top side and the left side are all 1s. If not, stop checking the cell `(i, j)` further and move to the next cell. Otherwise, check the other two sides. If all four sides have all 1s, then update the maximum side of the square.

Finally, calculate the area as the square of the maximum side of the square, and return.
