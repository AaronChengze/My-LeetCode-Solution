# 1151. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary array `data`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all `1`'s present in the array together in **any place** in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,0,1,0,1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:

[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.

[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.

[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.

The minimum is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [0,0,0,1,0]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].

**Note:**

1. `1 <= data.length <= 10^5`
2. `0 <= data[i] <= 1`

## Solution
First loop over array `data` to count the number of 1's, which is `ones`. Next use sliding window. If all 1's are grouped together, then they are in a window of size `ones`. In each window of size `ones`, each 0 needs to be swapped with a 1 that is outside the window, so the number of swaps required equals the number of 0's in the window. Therefore, for each window of size `ones`, count the number of 1's and obtain the maximum number of 1's in any window. The minimum number of swaps required equals `ones` minus the maximum number of 1's in any window.
