# 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given an array of strings `words` and a string chars.

A string is *good* if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** 

The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:**

The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
2. `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
3. All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

## Solution
For each string in `words`, check whether the string is good. To check whether a string is good, for the string from `words` and the string `chars`, count the number of each letter. The string is good if and only if for any letter, the count of the letter in the string does not exceed the letter in `chars`.

If a string is good, then add the string's length to the sum. Finally, return the sum.
