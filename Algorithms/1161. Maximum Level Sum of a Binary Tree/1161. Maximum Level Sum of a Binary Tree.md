# 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of its children is `2`, and so on.

Return the **smallest** level `X` such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level `X` is **maximal**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Level 1 sum = 1.

Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.

Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.

So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the given tree is between `1` and `10^4`.
2. `-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5`

## Solution
Use breadth first search, where all the nodes in the same level are visited. Maintain the maximum level sum and the corresponding level. Initially, the maximum level sum equals the root's value and the corresponding level is level 1. For each level, if the level's sum is **strictly** greater than the maximum level sum, then update the maximum level sum using the current level's sum and the corresponding level using the current level. Finally, return the level with the maximum level sum.
