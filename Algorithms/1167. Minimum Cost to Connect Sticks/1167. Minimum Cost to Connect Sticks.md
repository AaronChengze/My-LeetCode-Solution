# 1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
## Level
Medium

## Description
You have some `sticks` with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths `X` and `Y` into one stick by paying a cost of `X + Y`. You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given `sticks` into one stick in this way.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sticks = [2,4,3]

**Output:** 14

**Example 2:**

**Input:** sticks = [1,8,3,5]

**Output:** 30

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution
Use the greedy approach. Use a priority queue to store all elements in `sticks`, where the minimum element is polled from the priority queue each time. While the priority queue contains at least 2 elements, poll 2 elements, calculate the sum, add the sum to the cost, and offer the sum to the priority queue. Repeat the process until the priority queue only contains 1 element. Then return the cost.
