# 1175. Prime Arrangements
## Level
Easy

## Description
Return the number of permutations of 1 to `n` so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed).

*(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)*

Since the answer may be large, return the answer **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:** For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 100

**Output:** 682289015

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`

## Solution
First, count the number of prime numbers between 1 to `n` inclusively. Suppose there are `x` prime numbers between 1 to `n` exclusively, then there are `y` numbers that are not prime (the number is either 1 or a composite number) such that `x + y == n`. Since there are `x` prime indices (which means the index is a prime number) between 1 and `n` inclusively, the count of prime numbers is the same as the count of prime indices, so exactly all the prime numbers are at prime indices, and the numbers that are not prime are at indices that are not prime.

So the result is simply `x! * y! % (10^9 + 7)`.
