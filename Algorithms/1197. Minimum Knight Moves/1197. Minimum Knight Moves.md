# 1197. Minimum Knight Moves
## Level
Medium

## Description
In an **infinite** chess board with coordinates from `-infinity` to `+infinity`, you have a **knight** at square `[0, 0]`.

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square `[x, y]`. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 2, y = 1

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** [0, 0] ¡ú [2, 1]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 5, y = 5

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** [0, 0] ¡ú [2, 1] ¡ú [4, 2] ¡ú [3, 4] ¡ú [5, 5]

**Constraints:**

* `|x| + |y| <= 300`

## Solution
According to the constraint, the size of the chess board is limited, so limit the chess board size to some smaller value. For example, suppose the chess board is `800 * 800`, and the knight is initially at `[400, 400]`. The square `[x, y]` is adjusted to `[x + 400, y + 400]` accordingly.

Simply use breadth first search. A knight has at most 8 possible moves, so for each possible move, check whether the knight is still in the chess board after the move, and add the next square to the queue if it is still in the chess board. In this way, the search space can be reduced significantly.

Once the (updated) square `[x, y]` is reached, return the steps to reach the square, which is guaranteed to be the minimum number of steps.
