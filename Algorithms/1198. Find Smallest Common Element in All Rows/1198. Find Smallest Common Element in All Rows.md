# 1198. Find Smallest Common Element in All Rows
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a matrix `mat` where every row is sorted in **increasing** order, return the **smallest common element** in all rows.

If there is no common element, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]

**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 500`
* `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4`
* `mat[i]` is sorted in increasing order.

## Solution
Maintain an index for each row of `mat`. Each time obtain an element from each row using the row's current index. If the elements are all the same, then return the element. If the elements are different, then for the rows that have smaller elements, increase the corresponding indices by 1. If a row's index exceeds the bound (which means the index is greater than or equal to `mat`'s number of columns), then there is no common element, so return -1.
