# 1210. Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations
## Level
Hard

## Description
In an `n*n` grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving from the top left corner at `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`. The grid has empty cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at `(n-1, n-2)` and `(n-1, n-1)`.

In one move the snake can:

* Move one cell to the right if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.

* Move down one cell if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.

* Rotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)` to `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)`.

* Rotate counterclockwise if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)` to `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)`.

Return the minimum number of moves to reach the target.

If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/24/image.png)
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,0,0,1,0],
               [0,0,0,0,1,1],
               [0,0,1,0,1,0],
               [0,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,1,1,0,0,0]]
Output: 11
Explanation:
One possible solution is [right, right, rotate clockwise, right, down, down, down, down, rotate counterclockwise, right, down].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1,1,1],
               [0,0,0,0,1,1],
               [1,1,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,0,0,0]]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1`
* It is guaranteed that the snake starts at empty cells.

## Solution
To find the minimum number of moves, use breadth first search. Since the snake spans 2 cells and has 2 different directions, store the information of 2 states for each cell.

The most part of the solution just uses the idea of breadth first solution. However, there are some points that need to pay attention to.

1. Create two 3D arrays `colors` and `distances` which are both of size `n*n*2`, where the first two dimensions represent the cell that contains the snake's tail, and the third dimension is 0 for horizontal position or 1 for vertical position. Obviously, for the rightmost column, the snake can't be in horizontal position, and for the last row, the snake can't be in vertical position.
2. The array `colors` stores colors that represent different states of the cells, where `BLOCK` means the cell can't be reached, `WHITE` means the cell hasn't been visited, `GRAY` means the cell has been visited but not all of its adjacent states are visited, and `BLACK` means the cell has been visited and all of its adjacent states are visited.
3. The array `distances` stores the minimum distances of each cell and direction. Initialize all elements in `distances` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` except the start state.
4. For each move, the snake has three options, which are move right, move down and rotate. Since the rotate direction is determined by whether the snake is in a horizontal position or in a vertical position, there is only one way to rotate when the snake's previous state is determined. For each option, if it is possible, update the new state's distance.
5. The total moves to reach target is in `distances[n - 2][n - 1][0]`. If the target is reachable, return the value. Otherwise, the value is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, and return -1.
