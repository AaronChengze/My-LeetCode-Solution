# 1213. Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given three integer arrays `arr1`, `arr2` and `arr3` **sorted** in **strictly increasing** order, return a sorted array of **only** the integers that appeared in **all** three arrays.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]

**Output:** [1,5]

**Explanation:** Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000`

## Solution
Since all three arrays are sorted in strictly increasing order, it can be determined that if an array's current integer is greater than another array's current integer, then the another array's current integer can't be in the intersection.

Use three pointers in three arrays respectively to find the integers that appear in all three arrays. Initially, the three pointers point to the beginning of the three arrays respectively. Each time check the three integers that the three pointers point to. If a pointer points to an integer that is less than any of the other two integers, then move the pointer one step forward. Only if the three integers that three pointers point to are the same, the integer is in the intersection, and add the integer to the result list.
