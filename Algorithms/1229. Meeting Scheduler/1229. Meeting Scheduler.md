## Description
Given the availability time slots arrays `slots1` and `slots2` of two people and a meeting duration `duration`, return the **earliest time slot** that works for both of them and is of duration `duration`.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an **empty array**.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements `[start, end]` representing an inclusive time range from `start` to `end`.  

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots `[start1, end1]` and `[start2, end2]` of the same person, either `start1 > end2` or `start2 > end1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 8

**Output:** [60,68]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 12

**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= slots1.length, slots2.length <= 10^4`
* `slots1[i].length, slots2[i].length == 2`
* `slots1[i][0] < slots1[i][1]`
* `slots2[i][0] < slots2[i][1]`
* `0 <= slots1[i][j], slots2[i][j] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= duration <= 10^6`

## Solution
First, sort both `slots1` and `slots2` according to start time in ascending order.

Next, use two indices for both slots arrays to point to slots. If the two slots from two arrays have no intersection, then find the index of the slot with a smaller end time, and increase the index by 1. If the two slots from two arrays have intersection, then check whether the intersection range is at least `duration`. If so, obtain the smallest possible `start` and set `end = start + duration`, add both `start` and `end` to the result list, and return the result list. Otherwise, find the index of the slot with a smaller end time, and increase the index by 1. If both slots have the same end time, then increase both indices by 1. If no common time slot with range `duration` is found, return an empty list.
