# 1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a function `f(x, y)` and a value `z`, return all positive integer pairs `x` and `y` where `f(x,y) == z`.

The function is constantly increasing, i.e.:

* `f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)`
* `f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)`

The function interface is defined like this: 
```
interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns positive integer f(x, y) for any given positive integer x and y.
  int f(int x, int y);
};
```
For custom testing purposes you're given an integer `function_id` and a target `z` as input, where `function_id` represent one function from a secret internal list, on the examples you'll know only two functions from the list.  

You may return the solutions in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** function_id = 1, z = 5

**Output:** [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]

**Explanation:** function_id = 1 means that f(x, y) = x + y

**Example 2:**

**Input:** function_id = 2, z = 5

**Output:** [[1,5],[5,1]]

**Explanation:** function_id = 2 means that f(x, y) = x * y

Constraints:

* `1 <= function_id <= 9`
* `1 <= z <= 100`
* It's guaranteed that the solutions of `f(x, y) == z` will be on the range `1 <= x, y <= 1000`
* It's also guaranteed that `f(x, y)` will fit in 32 bit signed integer if `1 <= x, y <= 1000`

## Solution
Use monotonicity of the function. Since both `x` and `y` are in the range `[1, 1000]`, use a nested loop to find the integer pairs. For each `x` from 1 to 1000, take the value of `y` from 1 to 1000, and if there exists a pair `x` and `y` such that `f(x, y) == z`, then add the pair into the result list. Since `f(x, y) == z` and function `f` is monotonically increasing, for any value `y1` larger than `y`, there must be `f(x, y1) > z`, so there is no need to check on the current `x`. Go on to `x + 1` and take the values of `y`.
