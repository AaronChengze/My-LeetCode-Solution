# 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of strings `arr`. String `s` is a concatenation of a sub-sequence of `arr` which have **unique characters**.

Return *the maximum possible length* of `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = ["un","iq","ue"]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** All possible concatenations are "","un","iq","ue","uniq" and "ique". Maximum length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** Possible solutions are "chaers" and "acters".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]

**Output:** 26

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 16`
* `1 <= arr[i].length <= 26`
* `arr[i]` contains only lower case English letters.

## Solution
First loop over `arr` and remove all invalid strings. A string is invalid if it contains duplicate letters.

Use `maxLength` to represent the maximum possible length. Loop over `arr` (after removing invalid strings) and update `maxLength` as the maximum length of any string in `arr`.

For each string in `arr`, it can be either selected to be part of `s` or not selected. For each possible combination, if the combination is valid, which means the concatenation of all the strings in the combination have all characters unique, then update `maxLength`.

Finally, return `maxLength`.
