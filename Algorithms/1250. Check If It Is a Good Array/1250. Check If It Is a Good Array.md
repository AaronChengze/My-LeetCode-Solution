# 1250. Check If It Is a Good Array
## Level
Hard

## Description

Given an array nums of positive integers. Your task is to select some subset of `nums`, multiply each element by an integer and add all these numbers. The array is said to be **good** if you can obtain a sum of `1` from the array by any possible subset and multiplicand.

Return `True` if the array is **good** otherwise return `False`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [12,5,7,23]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Pick numbers 5 and 7.

5*3 + 7*(-2) = 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [29,6,10]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Pick numbers 29, 6 and 10.

29*1 + 6*(-3) + 10*(-1) = 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,6]

**Output:** false


**Constraints:**

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Solution
This problem is actually a number theory problem. Although marked as Hard difficulty, this problem can be easily solved once the number theory knowledge behind is applied.

For any two positive integers x and y, there exist two integers a and b such that a*x+b*y=1 if and only if the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1.

Therefore, just calculate the greatest common divisor of all the numbers in the given array `num`. If at one step, the greatest common divisor become 1, then stop calculating further since the greatest common divisor of 1 and any positive integer is 1.

If the greatest common divisor is 1, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
