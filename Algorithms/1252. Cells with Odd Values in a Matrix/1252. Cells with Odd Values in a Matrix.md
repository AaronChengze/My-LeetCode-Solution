# 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given `n` and m which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array `indices` where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]`. For each pair of `[ri, ci]` you have to increment all cells in row `ri` and column `ci` by 1.

Return *the number of cells with odd values* in the matrix after applying the increment to all `indices`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix will be [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]] which contains 6 odd numbers.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, m = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There is no odd number in the final matrix.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `1 <= m <= 50`
* `1 <= indices.length <= 100`
* `0 <= indices[i][0] < n`
* `0 <= indices[i][1] < m`

## Solution
This problem can be solved by simulating the process. However, this is time-consuming and not efficient.

An alternative solution is to count how many times each row is updated and how many times each column is updated. A number will become an odd number only if it is updated odd number of times. In other words, for the number at row `r` and column `c`, it will become an odd number only if row `r` is updated odd times and column `c` is updated even times, or row `r` is updated even times and column `c` is updated odd times.

So count the number of rows updated odd times `oddRows` and the number of columns updated odd times `oddColumns. The final result is `oddRows * (m - oddColumns) + oddColumns * (n - oddRows)`.
