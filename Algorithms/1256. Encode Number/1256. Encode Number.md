# 1256. Encode Number
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a non-negative integer `num`, Return its encoding string.

The encoding is done by converting the integer to a string using a secret function that you should deduce from the following table:

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 23

**Output:** "1000"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 107

**Output:** "101100"

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= num <= 10^9`

## Solution
If `n` is 0, then `f(n)` is `""`. If `1 <= n < 3`, then `f(n)` is a binary string with length 1. If `3 <= n < 7`, then `f(n)` is a binary string with length 2. If `7 <= n < 15`, then `f(n) is a binary string with length 3.

The encoding function is as follows. For the given number `num`, obtain the number of bits `bits` for number `num + 1`, where the number of bits means the number of bits remaining after removing leading zeros, calculate `difference` as the difference between `num + 1` and `2 ^ bits`, and return the binary representation of `difference`.
