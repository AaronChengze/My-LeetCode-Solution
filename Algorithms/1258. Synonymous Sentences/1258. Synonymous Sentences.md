# 1258. Synonymous Sentences
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a list of pairs of equivalent words `synonyms` and a sentence `text`, Return all possible synonymous sentences **sorted lexicographically**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
synonyms = [["happy","joy"],["sad","sorrow"],["joy","cheerful"]],
text = "I am happy today but was sad yesterday"
Output:
["I am cheerful today but was sad yesterday",
"I am cheerful today but was sorrow yesterday",
"I am happy today but was sad yesterday",
"I am happy today but was sorrow yesterday",
"I am joy today but was sad yesterday",
"I am joy today but was sorrow yesterday"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= synonyms.length <= 10`
* `synonyms[i].length == 2`
* `synonyms[0] != synonyms[1]`
* All words consist of at most `10` English letters only.
* `text` is a single space separated sentence of at most `10` words.

## Solution
Loop over `synonyms` and use a map to store each word and the set of its synonymous words. The set should contain all the word's synonymous words, including the word itself.

Then loop over each word in `text`. If a word has an entry in the map, then obtain all the synonymous words of the word and replace the word with each synonymous word to generate new sentences.
