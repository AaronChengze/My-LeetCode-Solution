# 1259. Handshakes That Don't Cross
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an **even** number of people `num_people` that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else, so that there are `num_people / 2` handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since this number could be very big, return the answer **mod `10^9 + 7`**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num_people = 2

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num_people = 4

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are two ways to do it, the first way is [(1,2),(3,4)] and the second one is [(2,3),(4,1)].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num_people = 6

**Output:** 5

**Example 4:**

**Input:** num_people = 8

**Output:** 14

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= num_people <= 1000`
* `num_people % 2 == 0`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Consider the number of pairs, which equals half the number of people. That is, let `numPairs = num_people / 2`. Create an array `dp` of length `numPairs + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways of `i` pairs of people's handshakes such that none of the handshakes cross. Initialize `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`. If there are two people, which is equivalent to one pair, then obviously there is one handshake and one way. If there are no people, then there is no handshake, which is also one way.

For `i` from 2 to `numPairs`, suppose the people are labelled from 1 to `2 * numPairs`, and consider the person with label 1, who can only shake hands with people with even labels to make sure none of the handshakes cross. Suppose the person with label 1 shakes hands with the person with label `n`, then there must be an even number of people in the label range 2 to `n - 1` and there must be an even number of people in the label range `n + 1` to `2 * numPairs`, so `n` must be an even number. For each even number `n`, since the person with label 1 and the person with label `n` shake hands, the rest of the people are divided into two groups, which have `n - 2` people and `2 * numPairs - n` people respectively. Therefore, for each `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, update `dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1]`. Remember to do the mod operation on each element of `dp`. Finally, return `dp[numPairs]`.
