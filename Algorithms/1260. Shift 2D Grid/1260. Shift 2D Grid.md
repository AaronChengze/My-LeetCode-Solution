# 1260. Shift 2D Grid
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a 2D `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `k`. You need to shift the `grid` `k` times.

In one shift operation:

* Element at `grid[i][j]` becomes at `grid[i][j + 1]`.
* Element at `grid[i][n - 1]` becomes at `grid[i + 1][0]`.
* Element at `grid[n - 1][n - 1]` becomes at `grid[0][0]`.

Return the *2D grid* after applying shift operation `k` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1

**Output:** [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[3,8,1,9],[19,7,2,5],[4,6,11,10],[12,0,21,13]], k = 4

**Output:** [[12,0,21,13],[3,8,1,9],[19,7,2,5],[4,6,11,10]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 9

**Output:** [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m <= 50`
* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `-1000 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
* `0 <= k <= 100`

## Solution
Let `rows` and `columns` to be the number of rows and the number of columns of `grid`, and let `size = rows * columns`. If `grid` is shifted `size` times, then the shifted grid is exactly the same before shifting, so only `k % size` shifts decide the result.

The i<sup>th</sup> element in the previous grid will be the ((i + k) % size)<sup>th</sup> in the grid after shifting. Update the elements accordingly.
