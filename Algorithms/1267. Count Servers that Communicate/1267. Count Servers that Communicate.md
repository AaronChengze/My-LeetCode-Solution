# 1267. Count Servers that Communicate
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a `m * n` integer matrix `grid`, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** No servers can communicate with others.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/13/untitled-diagram-4.jpg)

**Input:** grid = [[1,0],[1,1]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** All three servers can communicate with at least one other server.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The two servers in the first row can communicate with each other. The two servers in the third column can communicate with each other. The server at right bottom corner can't communicate with any other server.

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m <= 250`
* `1 <= n <= 250`
* `grid[i][j] == 0 or 1`

## Solution
The number of servers that communicate with any other server equals the number of servers in total minus the number of isolated servers. A server is isolated if and only if there is no any other server that shares the same row or the same column as the server.

Loop over `grid` to count the number of servers in total. Also use two maps to store the servers in each row and the servers in each column. After looping, for each row, obtain the number of servers in the row. If a row contains only one server, then obtain the server's column and obtain the number of servers in the column. If the row also contains only one server, then the server is isolated, so increase the number of isolated servers by 1.

Finally, obtain the number of servers that communicate with any other server by subtracting the number of isolated servers from the number of servers in total, and return.
