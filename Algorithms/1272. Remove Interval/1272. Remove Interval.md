# 1272. Remove Interval
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a **sorted** list of disjoint `intervals`, each interval `intervals[i] = [a, b]` represents the set of real numbers `x` such that `a <= x < b`.

We remove the intersections between any interval in `intervals` and the interval `toBeRemoved`.

Return a **sorted list** of `intervals` after all such removals.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[0,2],[3,4],[5,7]], toBeRemoved = [1,6]

**Output:** [[0,1],[6,7]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[0,5]], toBeRemoved = [2,3]

**Output:** [[0,2],[3,5]]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
* `-10^9 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^9`

## Solution
For each interval in `intervals`, compare the interval with the interval `toBeRemoved`, and store the remove status for each interval.

There are 5 statuses, each of which should be dealt with in the following way.

Status 0: `interval[1] <= toBeRemoved[0] || `interval[0] >= toBeRemoved[1]`. This status means that `interval` is disjoint with `toBeRemoved`, so simply keep `interval`.

Status 1: `interval[0] >= toBeRemoved[0] && interval[1] <= toBeRemoved[1]`. This status means that `interval` is completely contained in `toBeRemoved`, so `interval` is removed.

Status 2: `interval[0] < toBeRemoved[0] && interval[1] > toBeRemoved[1]`. This status means that `toBeRemoved` is completely contained in `interval`. After `toBeRemoved` is removed, there will be two disjoint intervals, which are `[interval[0], toBeRemoved[0]]` and `[toBeRemoved[1], interval[1]]`.

Status 3: `interval[0] < toBeRemoved[0] && interval[1] > toBeRemoved[0] && interval[1] <= toBeRemoved[1]`. After `toBeRemoved` is removed, only the left part of `interval` will be kept, and the remaining interval is `[interval[0], toBeRemoved[0]]`.

Status 4: `interval[0] >= toBeRemoved[0] && interval[0] < toBeRemoved[1] && interval[1] > toBeRemoved[1]`. After `toBeRemoved` is removed, only the right part of `interval` will be kept, and the remaining interval is `[toBeRemoved[1], interval[1]]`.

Do the corresponding operations for each interval in `intervals`.
