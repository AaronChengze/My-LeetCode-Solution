# 1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a `m * n` matrix of ones and zeros, return how many **square** submatrices have all ones.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
There are 6 squares of side 1.  
There is 1 square of side 2. 
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 300`
* `1 <= arr[0].length <= 300`
* `0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1`

## Solution
The maximum possible side length of a square submatrix is the minimum between the matrix's number of rows and the matrix's number of columns. For each side length from 1 to the maximum possible side length, count the number of square matrices that have all ones.

Use a 2D array `flags` with `boolean` type, where `flags[i][j]` represents whether the current square submatrix with top left corner at row `i` and column `j` has all ones. Initially all elements in `flags` are all `true`. If at one step a zero is found in a square submatrix, the corresponding element in `flags` is set to `false`. If for `i` and `j` there is `flags[i][j] == false`, then for square submatrices with top left corner at row `i` and column `j` with greater side lengths, it must contain one or more zeros, so there is no need to check the square submatrix.

Finally, return the number of square submatrices that have all ones.
