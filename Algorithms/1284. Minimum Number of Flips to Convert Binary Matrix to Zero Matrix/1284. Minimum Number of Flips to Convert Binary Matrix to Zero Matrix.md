# 1284. Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbours of it if they exist (Flip is changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighboors if they share one edge.

Return the *minimum number of steps* required to convert `mat` to a zero matrix or **-1** if you cannot.

Binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0 or 1 only.

Zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = [[0]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Given matrix is a zero matrix. We don't need to change it.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]

**Output:** 6

**Example 4:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,0,0],[1,0,0]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** Given matrix can't be a zero matrix

**Constraints:**

* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[0].length`
* `1 <= m <= 3`
* `1 <= n <= 3`
* `mat[i][j]` is 0 or 1.

## Solution
This problem can be converted to finding the shortest path, which can be solved using breadth first search. The target state is the zero matrix. If the target state can be reached starting from the initial state, then return the number of flips. Otherwise return `-1`.

Search from the initial state. At each step, for each cell do the flip operation. If the flipped state is already visited, then skip the state, otherwise update the new state and the number of flips for the state.

There are two casess that the search ends. The first case is that the zero matrix is reached, where the number of flips is returned. The second case is that all states have been searched but the zero matrix is not reached, where `-1` is returned.
