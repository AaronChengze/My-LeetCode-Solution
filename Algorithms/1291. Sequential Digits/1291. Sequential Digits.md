# 1291. Sequential Digits
## Level
Medium

## Description
An integer has *sequential digits* if and only if each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit.

Return a **sorted** list of all the integers in the range `[low, high]` inclusive that have sequential digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** low = 100, high = 300

**Output:** [123,234]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** low = 1000, high = 13000

**Output:** [1234,2345,3456,4567,5678,6789,12345]

**Constraints:**

* `10 <= low <= high <= 10^9`

## Solution
Since there are limited number of integers that have sequential digits, and an integer contains at most 9 digits if it has sequential digits, one way is to obtain the integers that have sequential digits according to the length.

Since both `low` and `high` are at least 10 and at most 10^9, the length of integers may be 2 to 9. After the integers that have sequential digits are obtained according to the length, select the integers within the range `[low, high]`.
