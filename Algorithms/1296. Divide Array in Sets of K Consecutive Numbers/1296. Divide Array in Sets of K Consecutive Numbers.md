# 1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find whether it's possible to divide this array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers.

Return `True` if its possible otherwise return `False`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4

**Output: true

**Explanation:** Array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,2,3,4,3,4,5,9,10,11], k = 3

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Array can be divided into [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5] and [9,10,11].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3,2,2,1,1], k = 3

**Output:** true

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** Each array should be divided in subarrays of size 3.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= k <= nums.length`

## Solution
First of all, check whether `nums.length` is divisible by `k`. If not, then obviously `nums` can't be divided into several sets with size `k` each, so return `False`.

Next, sort `nums` and add the numbers in `nums` into a list.

Since the objective is to divide all the numbers in `nums` into sets of `k` consecutive numbers, always start from the minimum remaining number. Suppose the number `min` is the minimum remaining number, then the numbers `min` to `min + k - 1` should form a set of `k` consecutive numbers (otherwise the number `min` won't belong to any set). Repeat the procedure until all the numbers are in the corresponding sets. If this can be done, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
