# 1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array `arr`, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with `-1`.

After doing so, return the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]

**Output:** [18,6,6,6,1,-1]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution
First consider the special cases. If the given array `arr` is `null` or has length 0, then return the array directly. If `arr` has length 1, then return an array with length 1 and contains the element `-1`.

Next consider the general cases. Suppose the given array `arr` has length `length`, then the return array which is called `newArray` also has length `length`. Obviously, `newArray[length - 1]` equals `-1` and `newArray[length - 2]` equals `arr[length - 1]`. For the rest indices `i` such that `0 ≤ i ≤ length - 3`, `newArray[i]` is the maximum between `arr[i + 1]` or `newArray[i + 1]`.
