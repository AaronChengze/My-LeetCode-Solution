**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]

**Output:** 15

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `10^4`.
* The value of nodes is between `1` and `100`.

## Solution
In a binary tree, the deepest leaves are the nodes at the maximum depth.

Starting from the root, perform breadth first search, which visits all the nodes at the same level at each step. At each level, obtain the number of nodes at the level, and calculate the sum of all the nodes' values. If no children for all nodes at the level, then the level is the maximum depth, and return the sum.
