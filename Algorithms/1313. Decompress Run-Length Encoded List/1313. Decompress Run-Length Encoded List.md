# 1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List
## Level
Easy

## Description
We are given a list `nums` of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements `[a, b] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` (with `i >= 0`). For each such pair, there are `a` elements with value `b` in the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** [2,4,4,4]

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `nums.length % 2 == 0`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Solution
In the array `nums`, the numbers at even indices represent numbers of each element, and the numbers at odd indices represent values of each element.

To decompress the numbers, each time obtain two numbers, and add the value to the decompressed list for the corresponding number of times.
