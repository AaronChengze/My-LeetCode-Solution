# 1314. Matrix Block Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a `m * n` matrix `mat` and an integer `K`, return a matrix `answer` where each `answer[i][j]` is the sum of all elements `mat[r][c]` for `i - K <= r <= i + K, j - K <= c <= j + K`, and `(r, c)` is a valid position in the matrix.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], K = 1

**Output:** [[12,21,16],[27,45,33],[24,39,28]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], K = 2

**Output:** [[45,45,45],[45,45,45],[45,45,45]]

**Constraints:**

* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n, K <= 100`
* `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100`

## Solution
Since the number of rows of the matrix, the number of columns of the matrix and the window size `K` are all less than or equal to 100, this problem can be solved using brute force.

For each cell, calculate the sum of all elements in the window where the cell is the center and the side length of the window is `2 * K + 1`, and set the value in the corresponding cell in the result matrix.
