# 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A *grandparent* of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)

If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]

**Output:** 18

**Explanation:** The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `10^4`.
* The value of nodes is between `1` and `100`.

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Each time a node is visited, if the node is even-valued and the node is not a leaf, then the node's children will be recorded as having an even-valued parent. If a node has an even-valued parent and the node is not a leaf, then the node's children's values are added to the sum.
