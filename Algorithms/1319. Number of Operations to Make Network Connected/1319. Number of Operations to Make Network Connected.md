# 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected
## Level
Medium

## Description
There are n computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between computers `a` and `b`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

Given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected. Return the *minimum number of times* you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it's not possible, return -1. 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]

**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There are not enough cables.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 5, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,4],[2,3]]

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= connections.length <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 10^5)`
* `connections[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] < n`
* `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
* There are no repeated connections.
* No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

## Solution
Each operation changes which two computers are connected by a cable, and the number of cables does not change. For `n` computers, to connect them together, the minimum number of cables is `n - 1`, when the computers and the cables form a tree.

If the number of cables is less than `n - 1`, then it is impossible to connect all computers, so return -1.

If there are at least `n - 1` cables, then it is guaranteed that all computers can be connected. Calculate the number of connected components. If the number of connected components is 1, then all the computers are already connected, so no operation is needed. If the number of connected components is greater than 1, then each operation can make two distinct connected components connect together and the number of connected components decrease by 1. Since there are enough cables, there is always a way to remove a cable from a connected component while keeping the component still connected. So after the number of connected components is obtained, return the result as the number of connected components minus 1.
