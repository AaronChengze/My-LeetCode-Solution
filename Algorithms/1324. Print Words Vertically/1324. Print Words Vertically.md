# 1324. Print Words Vertically
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string `s`. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in `s`.
Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is necessary. (Trailing spaces are not allowed).
Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be only one word.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
Explanation: Each word is printed vertically. 
 "HAY"
 "ORO"
 "WEU"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]
Explanation: Trailing spaces is not allowed. 
"TBONTB"
"OEROOE"
"   T"
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "CONTEST IS COMING"
Output: ["CIC","OSO","N M","T I","E N","S G","T"]
```

**Constraints:**

`1 <= s.length <= 200`
* `s` contains only upper case English letters.
* It's guaranteed that there is only one space between 2 words.

## Solution
First, split `s` by spaces into an array of strings. Then find the maximum length among all the strings in the array, which is `maxLength`.

Create a list that stores `maxLength` strings. For each string in the array, append each character to the corresponding string in the list. If a string in the array has length less than `maxLength`, then append spaces to the remaining strings in the list. Next, check each string in the list to see whether the string ends with a space. If so, remove the spaces at the end of the string until the string doesn't end with a space.

Finally, return the list.
