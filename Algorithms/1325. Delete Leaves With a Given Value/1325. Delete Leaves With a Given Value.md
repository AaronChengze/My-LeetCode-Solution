# 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree root and an integer `target`, delete all the **leaf nodes** with value `target`.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value `target`, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value `target`, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2

**Output:** [1,null,3,null,4]

**Explanation:** Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3

**Output:** [1,3,null,null,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2

**Output:** [1]

**Explanation:** Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = [1,1,1], target = 1

**Output:** []

**Example 5:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3], target = 1

**Output:** [1,2,3]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= target <= 1000`
* Each tree has at most `3000` nodes.
* Each node's value is between `[1, 1000]`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search and use a map to store each node's parent. For each entry in the map, the key is the child node and the value is the parent node. For each child node, check whether it is a leaf and its value equals `target`. If so, check whether the child is is parent's left child or right child and set the parent's corresponding child to `null`, and remove the entry from the map. Continue this process until no more nodes are removed.
