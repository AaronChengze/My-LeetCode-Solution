# 1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point `0` and ends at the point `n`. (i.e The length of the garden is `n`).

There are `n + 1` taps located at points `[0, 1, ..., n]` in the garden.

Given an integer `n` and an integer array `ranges` of length `n + 1` where `ranges[i]` (0-indexed) means the `i-th` tap can water the area `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it was open.

Return *the minimum number of taps* that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return **-1**.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/1685_example_1.png)

**Input:** n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]

The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]

The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]

The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]

The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]

The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]

Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 7, ranges = [1,2,1,0,2,1,0,1]

**Output:** 3

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 8, ranges = [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4]

**Output:** 2

**Example 5:**

**Input:** n = 8, ranges = [4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `ranges.length == n + 1`
* `0 <= ranges[i] <= 100`

## Solution
This problem is equivalent to find the minimum number of taps that should be open to water all `n` intervals, where the `i-th` interval is from point `i` to point `i + 1` (0-indexed). For each tap, find the range of intervals it can water.

Use greedy algorithm. For interval 0, find the tap that can water interval 0 and can water the most intervals, then mark all the intervals in the range of the tap to watered. For intervals 1 to `n - 1`, if the interval is already watered, skip to the next interval. Otherwise, find the tap that can water the interval and can water the most intervals that haven't been watered. After all the intervals are visited, if all the intervals are watered, return the number of taps to open. Otherwise, return -1.

The reason that the algorithm works is as follows. Interval 0 must be watered, and if there are several taps that can water interval 0, then the tap that can water the most intervals is optimal. For the other intervals that haven't been watered, also it must be watered, so find a tap that can water the interval. Since some other intervals may have already been watered, find the interval that can water the current interval and can water the most intervals that haven't been watered, which is optimal.
