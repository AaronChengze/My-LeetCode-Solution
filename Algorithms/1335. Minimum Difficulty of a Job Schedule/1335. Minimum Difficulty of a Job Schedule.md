# 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule
## Level
Hard

## Description
You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `i-th` job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).

You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `i-th` job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return *the minimum difficulty* of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return **-1**.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/untitled.png)

**Input:** jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:** First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.

Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.

The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3

**Output:** 15

**Example 5:**

**Input:** jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6

**Output:** 843

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
* `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= d <= 10`

## Solution
Since at least one task should be finished every day, the total number of days `d` must be less than or equal to the length of `jobDifficulty`. Otherwise, return -1.

Use dynamic programming. Suppose the length of `jobDifficulty` is `length`. Create a 2D array `dp` with `d` rows and `length` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum difficulty on day `i` for finishing task `j`.

For `0 <= j <= length - d`, `dp[0][j]` can be easily obtained as the maximum element in the subarray `jobDifficulty[0..j]`.

To obtain `dp[i][j]` where `i > 0` and `i <= j <= length - d + i`, find the minimum possible value of `dp[i - 1][k] + max`, where `k` ranges from `j - 1` to `i - 1` and `max` is the maximum element in subarray `jobDifficulty[k + 1 .. j]`.

Finally, return `dp[d - 1][length - 1]`.
