# 1343. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree `root`. Split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing 1 edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees are maximized.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

**Output:** 110

**Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]

**Output:** 90

**Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]

**Output:** 1025

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = [1,1]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* Each tree has at most `50000` nodes and at least `2` nodes.
* Each node's value is between `[1, 10000]`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search on the binary tree and store all the nodes in a list in the order that the nodes are visited. During the search, also use a map to store each node's parent. Then loop over the list in the reversing order except the root. Each time a node is met, add its value to its parent's value. After the loop, all nodes' values are updated such that each node's value is the sum of all the nodes' values in the subtree where the node is the root of the subtree.

For each node except the root, removing the edge that connects the node and its parent will split the binary tree into two subtrees. One subtree is the subtree where the node is the root, and the sum of all nodes' values in this subtree is the node's value. The other subtree is a subtree where the original root is the root, and the sum of all nodes' values in this subtree is the root's value minus the node's value (the node is the root of the first subtree). Since both subtrees' sums are obtained, the product can be calculated. Update the maximum product. After all the nodes except the root are used as the root of a subtree, the maximum product is obtained, and return the maximum product modulo 10^9 + 7.

According to the constraints, each tree has at most 50000 nodes and each node's value is at most 10000, so the maximum possible sum of the nodes' values in the original tree is 5 * 10^8. If the maximum tree is split into two subtrees, the maximum possible product is (2.5 * 10^8) * (2.5 * 10^8) = 6.25 * 10^16, which can be represented using a data type `long`. So use a variable of data type `long` to store the maximum product.
