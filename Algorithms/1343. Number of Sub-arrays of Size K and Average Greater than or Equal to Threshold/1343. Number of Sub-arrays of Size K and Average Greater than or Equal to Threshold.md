# 1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`.

Return *the number of sub-arrays* of size `k` and average greater than or equal to `threshold`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 1, threshold = 0

**Output:** 5

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7], k = 7, threshold = 7

**Output:** 1

**Example 5:**

**Input:** arr = [4,4,4,4], k = 4, threshold = 1

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`
* `1 <= k <= arr.length`
* `0 <= threshold <= 10^4`

## Solution
Calculate `sumThreshold = threshold * k`, and this problem can be converted to finding the number of sub-arrays of size `k` and sum greater than or equal to `sumThreshold`. The first sub-array of size `k` is the subarray that starts from index 0 and ends at index `k - 1`. For each sub-array of size `k` that ends at index `i` where `i <= k < arr.length`, the sub-array starts from index `i - k + 1`. Therefore, for a new sub-array that ends at index `i`, the new sub-array can be obtained by adding the element at index `i` and removing the element at index `i - k`. For each sub-array of size `k`, calculate the sum of the sub-array and count the number of sub-arrays that have sum greater than or equal to `sumThreshold`. Finally, return the count.
