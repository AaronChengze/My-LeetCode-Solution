**Constraints:**

* `1 <= hour <= 12`
* `0 <= minutes <= 59`
* Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

## Solution
Calculate the angles of the hour hand and the minute hand from zero point respectively. For example, for 3:30, the angle of the hour hand is 105 degrees, and the angle of the minute hand is 180 degrees. Then calculate the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand by calculating the absolute difference of the two angles. Since the smaller angle is required, if the angle is greater than 180 degrees, then subtract the angle formed between the two hands from 360 degrees to obtain the smaller angle formed between the two hands.

The angles of the two hands from zero point are calculated as follows.

For the hour hand, since there are 12 hours and 360 degrees in total, the base angle is `hour * 30` degrees. Also since there is another angle if `minutes` is greater than 0, and the angle is 30 degrees for 60 minutes, add another `minutes * 30.0 / 60` degrees to the angle.

For the minute hand, since there are 60 minutes and 360 degrees in total, the angle is `minutes * 6` degrees.
