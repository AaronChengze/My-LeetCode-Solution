# 1346. Check If N and Its Double Exist
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exists two integers `N` and `M` such that `N` is the double of `M` (i.e. `N = 2 * M`).

More formally check if there exists two indices `i` and `j` such that :

* `i != j`
* `0 <= i, j < arr.length`
* `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [10,2,5,3]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** N = 10 is the double of M = 5,that is, 10 = 2 * 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [7,1,14,11]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** N = 14 is the double of M = 7,that is, 14 = 2 * 7.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [3,1,7,11]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** In this case does not exist N and M, such that N = 2 * M.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= arr.length <= 500`
* `-10^3 <= arr[i] <= 10^3`

## Solution
Use a set to store the elements in `arr`. The case of zero needs to be considered separately since the double of zero is itself. When adding elements to the set, if there are two zeros met in the array (which means when adding a zero into the set, there is already a zero in the set), then one zero is the double of the other zero, so return `true`.

After adding all the elements into the set, loop over `arr` and for each number, check whether the double of the number is in the set. If so, return `true`. If no double is found, return `false`.
