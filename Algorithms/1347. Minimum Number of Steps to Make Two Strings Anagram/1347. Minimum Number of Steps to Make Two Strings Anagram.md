# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two equal-size strings `s` and `t`. In one step you can choose **any character** of `t` and replace it with **another character**.

Return *the minimum number of steps* to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

An **Anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "bab", t = "aba"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode", t = "practice"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. 

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "xxyyzz", t = "xxyyzz"

**Output:** 0

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s = "friend", t = "family"

**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 50000`
* `s.length == t.length`
* `s` and `t` contain lower-case English letters only.

## Solution
Two strings are anagrams of each other if and only if the two strings have the same number of occurrences for each letter. Therefore, to solve this problem, the number of letters that needs to be changed should be determined.

Loop over both `s` and `t` and find the difference of each letter's number of occurrences between `s` and `t`. Use positive numbers to represent the case that the letter has more occurrences in `s` than in `t`, and use negative numbers to represent the case that the letter has more occurrences in `t` than in `s`. For example, if `s = "bab"` and `t = "aba"`, then the difference of `'a'` is -1 and the difference of `'b'` is 1. Since `s` and `t` have the same length, the sum of all the differences is 0. Replace the letters of positive differences with the letters of negative differences to make `t` an anagram of `s`. The result is simply the sum of all positive differences.
