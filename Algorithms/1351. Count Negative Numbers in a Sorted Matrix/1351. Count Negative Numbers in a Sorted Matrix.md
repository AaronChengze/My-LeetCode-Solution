# 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a `m * n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise. 

Return the number of **negative** numbers in `grid`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]

**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]

**Output:** 3

**Example 4:**

**Input:** grid = [[-1]]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

## Solution
Since all rows and columns of `grid` are sorted in non-increasing order, loop over each row of `grid` backward and count the number of negative numbers.

For each row of `grid` from bottom to top, loop over each row from right to left. If a negative number is met, increase the counter by 1. Otherwise, stop searching further in this row, and move to the upper row. If a row's rightmost number is non-negative, then no more negative numbers exist, so stop the loop. Finally, return the counter.
