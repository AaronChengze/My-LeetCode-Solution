# 1360. Number of Days Between Two Dates
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write a program to count the number of days between two dates.

The two dates are given as strings, their format is `YYYY-MM-DD` as shown in the examples.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** date1 = "2019-06-29", date2 = "2019-06-30"

**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** date1 = "2020-01-15", date2 = "2019-12-31"

**Output:** 15

**Constraints:**

* The given dates are valid dates between the years `1971` and `2100`.

## Solution
One solution is to create two `Date` objects using `date1` and `date2` and calculate the difference of days between the two `Date` objects.

This solution provides another way to solve the problem. For both `date1` and `date2`, split the years, months and days. If `date1` is greater than `date2`, then swap the information of `date1` and `date2`. Then calculate the number of days in the year for both dates. For example, If the date is "2020-02-23", then the number of days in the year is 54, since "2020-02-23" is the 54<sup>th</sup> day in year 2020. If `date1` and `date2` are in the same year, then simply calculate the difference between the numbers of days and return. If `date1` and `date2` are in different years, then calculate the difference of the years, and calculate the number of days between accordingly.
