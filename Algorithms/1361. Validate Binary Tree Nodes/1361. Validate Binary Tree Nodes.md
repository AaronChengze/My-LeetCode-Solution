# 1361. Validate Binary Tree Nodes
## Level
Medium

## Description
You have `n` binary tree nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where node i has two children `leftChild[i]` and `rightChild[i]`, return `true` if and only if **all** the given nodes form **exactly one** valid binary tree.

If node `i` has no left child then `leftChild[i]` will equal `-1`, similarly for the right child.

Note that the nodes have no values and that we only use the node numbers in this problem.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,-1]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,3,-1,-1]

**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/23/1503_ex3.png)

**Input:** n = 2, leftChild = [1,0], rightChild = [-1,-1]

**Output:** false

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/23/1503_ex4.png)

**Input:** n = 6, leftChild = [1,-1,-1,4,-1,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,5,-1,-1]

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `leftChild.length == rightChild.length == n`
* `-1 <= leftChild[i], rightChild[i] <= n - 1`

## Solution
Since each node has at most one left child and one right child, if the directed graph is a tree, then it must be a binary tree. Therefore, simply check whether the directed graph is a tree.

If a graph with `n` nodes is a tree, then the following two requirements must be met.
1. The graph must contain `n - 1` edges.
2. Each node may have at most one parent.

For `0 <= i < n`, obtain the values `leftChild[i]` and `rightChild[i]`. The value `i` is the parent of both values `leftChild[i]` and `rightChild[i]` if the values are not -1, and an edge exists between the parent of a child. If any child already has a parent, then the child has two parents, so return `false`. After all the children are obtained, check the number of edges. I the number of edges does not equal `n - 1`, return `false`.

After all the nodes' parents are obtained, find the root of the binary tree. The root should not have a parent. If the number of nodes that do not have a parent is not 1, return `false`.

Then do breadth first search starting from the root. If all the nodes are reachable from the root, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
