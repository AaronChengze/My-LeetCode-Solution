# 1362. Closest Divisors
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer `num`, find the closest two integers in absolute difference whose product equals `num + 1` or `num + 2`.

Return the two integers in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 8

**Output:** [3,3]

**Explanation:** For num + 1 = 9, the closest divisors are 3 & 3, for num + 2 = 10, the closest divisors are 2 & 5, hence 3 & 3 is chosen.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 123

**Output:** [5,25]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = 999

**Output:** [40,25]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num <= 10^9`

## Solution
Let `num1 = num + 1` and `num2 = num + 2`. Calculate the square roots of `num1` and `num2` respectively. For each number `num1` and `num2`, loop over 1 to the square root and find the maximum factor in the range such that the number is divisible by the factor. Suppose the maximum factor of `num1` is `factor1` and the maximum factor of `num2` is `factor3`. Let `factor2 = num1 / factor1` and `factor4 = num2 / factor3`. Calculate the absolute difference between `factor2` and `factor1` and the absolute difference between `factor4` and `factor3`, and return the two factors with a smaller absolute difference.
