# 1367. Linked List in Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree `root` and a linked list with `head` as the first node. 

Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the `head` correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree otherwise return False.

In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [4,2,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Nodes in blue form a subpath in the binary Tree.  

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/12/sample_2_1720.png)

**Input:** head = [1,4,2,6], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]

**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1,4,2,6,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** There is no path in the binary tree that contains all the elements of the linked list from head.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= node.val <= 100` for each node in the linked list and binary tree.
* The given linked list will contain between `1` and `100` nodes.
* The given binary tree will contain between `1` and `2500` nodes.

## Solution
First do breadth first search in the binary tree and find all the nodes with the same value as `head`. Then starting from each of the nodes, check whether there exists a child that has the same value as the next node in the linked list. Repeat the process until the end of the linked list is reached or no more nodes in the binary tree are available. If no more nodes in the binary tree are available, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.
