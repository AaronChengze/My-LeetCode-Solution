# 1377. Frog Position After T Seconds
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from 1 to `n`. A frog starts jumping from the **vertex 1**. In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another **unvisited** vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to several vertices it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability, otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex it jumps forever on the same vertex. 

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` means that exists an edge connecting directly the vertices `from_i` and `to_i`.

*Return the probability that after `t` seconds the frog is on the vertex `target`.*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4

**Output:** 0.16666666666666666 

**Explanation:** The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666. 

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/20/frog_3.png)

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 1, target = 7

**Output:** 0.3333333333333333

**Explanation:** The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 = 0.3333333333333333 probability to the vertex 7 after second 1. 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 20, target = 6

**Output:** 0.16666666666666666

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `edges.length == n-1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n`
* `1 <= t <= 50`
* `1 <= target <= n`
* Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

## Solution
Although the graph is a tree, since the graph is undirected, the parent-child relations are not explicitly given. Therefore, the parent-child relations should be figured out first.

Loop over `edges` and for each vertex, store all the vertices that the vertex can access directly. Since the frog starts jumping from the vertex 1, vertex 1 is considered as the root. Each time, the frog can only randomly jump to one of the current vertex's children.

Then do breadth first search starting from vertex 1. Each time a vertex is visited, check all its children, which are the vertices that have not been visited and can be directly accessed from the current vertex. After the search, each vertex's parent vertex can be obtained.

After the parent-child relations are obtained, find the path from `target` to vertex 1 (such that each step in the path moves from a child to its parent), store all the vertices in the path in a set (including `target` and the root vertex 1), and calculate the length of the path. If the length of the path is greater than `t`, then it is impossible for the frog to reach the target at time `t`, so return 0. If the length of the path is less than `t`, then check whether `target` has children. If `target` has children, then the frog will not stay at `target` and it will jump to other vertices, so return 0.

Initialize the probability to 1. Do breadth first search for the second time, using the parent-child relations (different from the first time). For each vertex met, if it has `k` children, then divide the probability by `k`, and **only** offer the vertex in the path from `target` to vertex 1 to the queue. Repeat the process until a leaf node is met of the queue becomes empty.

Finally, return the probability.
