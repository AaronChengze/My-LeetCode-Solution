# 1115. Print FooBar Alternately
## Level
Medium

## Description
Suppose you are given the following code:
```
class FooBar {
  public void foo() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("foo");
    }
  }

  public void bar() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      print("bar");
    }
  }
}
```
The same instance of `FooBar` will be passed to two different threads. Thread A will call `foo()` while thread B will call `bar()`. Modify the given program to output "foobar" *n* times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Output:** "foobar"

**Explanation:** There are two threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls foo(), while the other calls bar(). "foobar" is being output 1 time.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** "foobarfoobar"

**Explanation:** "foobar" is being output 2 times.

## Solution
This problem can be solved using semaphores. In the class, create two semaphores `semaphoreFoo` and `semaphoreBar` for methods `foo()` and `bar()` respectively. Initially, `semaphoreFoo` has 1 permit, while `semaphoreBar` has 0 permits.

For each method `foo()` and `bar()`, in the loop, there are three steps. The first step is to acquire a permit from the current semaphore. The second step is to call the `run()` method for the `Runnable` object. The third step is to release a permit back to the next semaphore.
