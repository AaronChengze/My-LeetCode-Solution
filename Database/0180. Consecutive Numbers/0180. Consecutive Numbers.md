# 180. Consecutive Numbers
## Level
Medium

## Description
Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
```
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
```
For example, given the above `Logs` table, `1` is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

## Solution
Use three entries in `Log` table to represent three entries that have consecutive ids and the same number.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct t1.Num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs t1, Logs t2, Logs t3
where t1.Id = t2.Id - 1 and t3.Id = t2.Id + 1
  and t1.Num = t2.Num and t2.Num = t3.Num;
```
