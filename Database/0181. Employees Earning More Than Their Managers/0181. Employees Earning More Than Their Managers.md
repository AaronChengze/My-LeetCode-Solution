## Level
Easy

## Description
The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```
Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

## Solution
Use two entries in `Employee` table to represent the employee and the corresponding manager and add the required condition.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select
    emp.Name as 'Employee'
from
    Employee as emp,
    Employee as man
where
    emp.ManagerId = man.Id
    and emp.Salary > man.Salary
;
```
