# 183. Customers Who Never Order
## Level
Easy

## Description
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the `Customers` table and the `Orders` table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: `Customers`.
```
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```
Table: `Orders`.
```
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```
Using the above tables as example, return the following:
```
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

## Solution
Since the `Id` column in `Customers` table matches the `CustomerId` column in `Orders` table, use `Customers` to left join `Orders`. After the join, select the names of customers from entries where `CustomerId` is null, which means the customers do not have any order.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Name as Customers
    from Customers
    left join Orders
    on Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId
    where Orders.CustomerId is null;
```
