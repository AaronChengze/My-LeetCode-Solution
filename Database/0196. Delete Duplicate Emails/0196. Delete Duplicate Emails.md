# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails
## Level
Easy

## Description
Write a SQL query to **delete** all duplicate email entries in a table named `Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its *smallest* **Id**.
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
```
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```
**Note:**

Your output is the whole `Person` table after executing your sql. Use `delete` statement.

## Solution
Note that this problem requires deleting all duplicate emails, not selecting unique ones.

If an email occurs more than once, then delete the entries where the `Id` is not the smallest, that is, there exists another entry with the same value of `Email` but a smaller `Id`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
delete p2 from Person p1, Person p2
    where p1.Email = p2.Email
    and p1.Id < p2.Id;
```
