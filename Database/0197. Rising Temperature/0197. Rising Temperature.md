## Description
Given a `Weather` table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.
```
+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
```
For example, return the following Ids for the above `Weather` table:
```
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+
```

## Solution
Use function DATEDIFF to calculate the difference between two dates. If two entries' dates differ by 1, and the entry with a larger date has a higher temperature, then select the entry with a larger date.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select b.Id from Weather a, Weather b
    where DATEDIFF(b.RecordDate, a.RecordDate) = 1
    and b.Temperature > a.Temperature;
```
