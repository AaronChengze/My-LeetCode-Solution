## Level
Medium

## Description
The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.
```
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
```
Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:
```
+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
```
**Note:**

No one would report to himself.

## Solution
Let `e1` and `e2` be entries of `Employee` table where `e2` reports to `e1`. Use `select count(*)` to filter the managers that have at least 5 direct reports.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e1.Name from Employee e1
    where (select count(*) from Employee e2 where e2.ManagerId = e1.id) >= 5;
```
