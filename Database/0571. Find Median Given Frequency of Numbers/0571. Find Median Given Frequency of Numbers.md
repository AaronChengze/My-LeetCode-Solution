# 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers
## Level
Hard

## Description
The `Numbers` table keeps the value of number and its frequency.
```
+----------+-------------+
|  Number  |  Frequency  |
+----------+-------------|
|  0       |  7          |
|  1       |  1          |
|  2       |  3          |
|  3       |  1          |
+----------+-------------+
```
In this table, the numbers are `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3`, so the median is `(0 + 0) / 2 = 0`.
```
+--------+
| median |
+--------|
| 0.0000 |
+--------+
```
Write a query to find the median of all numbers and name the result as `median`.

## Solution
Suppose `n1.Number` is the median in table `Numbers`. Then the count of numbers less than or equal to `n1.Number` should be at least half of the total counts, and the count of numbers less than `n1.Number` should be at most half of the total counts.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select avg(Number) as median from (
    select n1.Number from Numbers n1 join Numbers n2 on n1.Number >= n2.Number
        group by n1.Number
        having
        sum(n2.Frequency) >= (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers) / 2
        and
        sum(n2.Frequency) - avg(n1.Frequency) <= (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers) / 2
) med;
```
