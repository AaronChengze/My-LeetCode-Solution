**Notes:**

1. You may assume **there is no tie**, in other words there will be **only one** winning candidate.

## Solution
First select the `CandidateId` that occurs the most in the `Vote` table. Next use the `CandidateId` as `id` to find the candidate's name from the `Candidate` table.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Name from Candidate where id in (
    select CandidateId from (
        select CandidateId, count(*) as counts from Vote
            group by CandidateId order by counts desc limit 1
    ) as Winner
);
```
