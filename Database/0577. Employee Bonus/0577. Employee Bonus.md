## Solution
Use `Employee left join Bonus` so that all the entries in `Employee` table are reserved. If an employee doesn't have bonus, then the employee's name should also be selected, which corresponds to `null` in the joined result.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Employee.name, Bonus.bonus from Employee left join Bonus
    on Employee.empId = Bonus.empId
    where bonus < 1000 or bonus is null;
```
