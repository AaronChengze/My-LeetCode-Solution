## Description
Given a table `customer` holding customers information and the referee.
```
+------+------+-----------+
| id   | name | referee_id|
+------+------+-----------+
|    1 | Will |      NULL |
|    2 | Jane |      NULL |
|    3 | Alex |         2 |
|    4 | Bill |      NULL |
|    5 | Zack |         1 |
|    6 | Mark |         2 |
+------+------+-----------+
```
Write a query to return the list of customers **NOT** referred by the person with id '2'.

For the sample data above, the result is:
```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

## Solution
The solution is quite straightforward. A customer is referred by the person with id '2' if and only if the `referee_id` field of the customer has value '2'. To return the customers not referred by the person with id '2', just return the entries where `referee_id` have other values or `null`. 
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name from customer
    where referee_id != 2
    or referee_id is null;
```
