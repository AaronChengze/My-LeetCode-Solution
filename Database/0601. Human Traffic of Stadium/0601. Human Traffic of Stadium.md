## Level
Hard

## Description
X city built a new stadium, each day many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: **id, visit_date, people**

Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).

For example, the table `stadium`:
```
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
```
For the sample data above, the output is:
```
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-08 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
```
**Note:**

Each day only have one row record, and the dates are increasing with id increasing.

## Solution
Suppose three consecutive rows in table are `s1`, `s2` and `s3` respectively. Each such row has `people` at least 100. Select all the fields of `s1`, where `s1` can be at any position among `s1`, `s2` and `s3`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct s1.* from stadium s1, stadium s2, stadium s3
    where ((s1.id = s2.id - 1 and s2.id = s3.id - 1) or
           (s1.id = s2.id + 1 and s1.id = s3.id - 1) or
           (s1.id = s3.id + 1 and s2.id = s3.id - 1))
        and (s1.people >= 100 and s2.people >= 100 and s3.people >= 100)
    order by s1.id;
```
