# 619. Biggest Single Number
## Level
Easy

## Description
Table `my_numbers` contains many numbers in column **num** including duplicated ones.

Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.
```
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
```
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
```
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
```
**Note:**

If there is no such number, just output **null**.

## Solution
Use `select max(num)` to select the biggest number. To select the biggest number that only appears once, use `having count(num) = 1` as a condition.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select max(num) as num
from (select num from my_numbers
      group by num
      having count(num) = 1) as t;
```
