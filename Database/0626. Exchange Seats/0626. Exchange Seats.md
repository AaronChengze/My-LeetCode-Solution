## Description
Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column **id** is continuous increment.

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```
For the sample input, the output is:
```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

**Note:**

If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

## Solution
Change each row's `id`, and sort the entries according to `id` in ascending order.

Use `case` statement to change the values of `id`. If `id % 2 = 0`, then change it to `id - 1`. Else, if `id` is the maximum `id`, then remain it unchanged. Else, change it to `id + 1`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select (
    case
        when id % 2 = 0 then id - 1
        when id = (select max(id) from seat) then id
        else id + 1
    end
) as id, student
    from seat
    order by id;
```
