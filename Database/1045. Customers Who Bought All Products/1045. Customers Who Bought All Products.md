Write an SQL query for a report that provides the customer ids from the `Customer` table that bought all the products in the `Product` table.

For example:
```
Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+

Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
The customers who bought all the products (5 and 6) are customers with id 1 and 3.
```

## Solution
First select the number of products each customer bought from table `Customer`. Next select the number of products in table `Product`. Finally join the two selection results and return the customers that have bought the same number of products as the total number of products.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct customer_id
    from (
        select customer_id, count(distinct product_key) as product_count
            from Customer
            group by customer_id
    ) as customer_product_counts
    join (
        select count(distinct product_key) as product_count from Product
    ) as product_counts
    on customer_product_counts.product_count = product_counts.product_count;
```
