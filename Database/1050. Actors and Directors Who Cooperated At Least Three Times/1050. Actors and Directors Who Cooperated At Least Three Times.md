## Description
Table: `ActorDirector`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs `(actor_id, director_id)` where the actor have cooperated with the director at least 3 times.

**Example:**
```
ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.
```

## Solution
Select entries with field `actor_id` and `director_id` from table `ActorDirector`. Since only the entries where the actor have cooperated with the director at least 3 times, the entries should be grouped by `actor_id` and `director_id`, and the count should be at least 3.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select actor_id, director_id from ActorDirector
    group by actor_id, director_id
    having count(actor_id) >= 3;
```
