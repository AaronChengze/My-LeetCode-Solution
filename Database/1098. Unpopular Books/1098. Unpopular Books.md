Write an SQL query that reports the **books** that have sold **less than 10** copies in the last year, excluding books that have been available for less than 1 month from today. **Assume today is 2019-06-23.**

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Books table:
+---------+--------------------+----------------+
| book_id | name               | available_from |
+---------+--------------------+----------------+
| 1       | "Kalila And Demna" | 2010-01-01     |
| 2       | "28 Letters"       | 2012-05-12     |
| 3       | "The Hobbit"       | 2019-06-10     |
| 4       | "13 Reasons Why"   | 2019-06-01     |
| 5       | "The Hunger Games" | 2008-09-21     |
+---------+--------------------+----------------+

Orders table:
+----------+---------+----------+---------------+
| order_id | book_id | quantity | dispatch_date |
+----------+---------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 1       | 2        | 2018-07-26    |
| 2        | 1       | 1        | 2018-11-05    |
| 3        | 3       | 8        | 2019-06-11    |
| 4        | 4       | 6        | 2019-06-05    |
| 5        | 4       | 5        | 2019-06-20    |
| 6        | 5       | 9        | 2009-02-02    |
| 7        | 5       | 8        | 2010-04-13    |
+----------+---------+----------+---------------+

Result table:
+-----------+--------------------+
| book_id   | name               |
+-----------+--------------------+
| 1         | "Kalila And Demna" |
| 2         | "28 Letters"       |
| 5         | "The Hunger Games" |
+-----------+--------------------+
```

## Solution
If a book has been sold less than 10 copies, then there are two cases. The first case is that the book has been sold at least 1 copy but less than 10 copies. The second case is that the book has never been sold.

For the first case, join `Books` and `Orders` and select the books with `sum(quantity) < 10`.

For the second case, select the books such that the `book_id` values are not in `Orders`.

The selection criteria also include that `available_from` is more than 1 month from the given date, and `dispatch_date` is in the last year.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Books.book_id, name from Books join Orders
    on Books.book_id = Orders.book_id
    where available_from < '2019-05-23'
    and dispatch_date between '2018-06-23' and '2019-06-23'
    group by Books.book_id
    having sum(quantity) < 10
    union
select book_id, name from Books
    where available_from < '2019-05-23'
    and book_id not in (
        select distinct book_id from Orders where dispatch_date between '2018-06-23' and '2019-06-23'
    );
```
