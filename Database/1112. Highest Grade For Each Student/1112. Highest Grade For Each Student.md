# 1112. Highest Grade For Each Student
## Level
Medium

## Description
Table: `Enrollments`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key of this table.
```
Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest `course_id`. The output must be sorted by increasing `student_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Enrollments table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+

Result table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
```

## Solution
For each student, find the highest grade. Then select `student`, `min(course_id) as course_id` and `grade` from table `Enrollments using the students' ids and the highest grades selected before. Finally, the result should be grouped by `student_id` so that each student's highest grade is in the result.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select student_id, min(course_id) as course_id, grade from Enrollments
    where (student_id, grade) in (
        select student_id, max(grade) from Enrollments group by student_id
    )
    group by student_id;
```
