| event_type    | varchar |
| occurences    | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occured at some business for a number of times.
```

Write an SQL query to find all *active businesses*.

An active business is a business that has more than one event type with occurences greater than the average occurences of that event type among all businesses.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Events table:
+-------------+------------+------------+
| business_id | event_type | occurences |
+-------------+------------+------------+
| 1           | reviews    | 7          |
| 3           | reviews    | 3          |
| 1           | ads        | 11         |
| 2           | ads        | 7          |
| 3           | ads        | 6          |
| 1           | page views | 3          |
| 2           | page views | 12         |
+-------------+------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| business_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+ 
Average for 'reviews', 'ads' and 'page views' are (7+3)/2=5, (11+7+6)/3=8, (3+12)/2=7.5 respectively.
Business with id 1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8) so it is an active business.
```

## Solution
Select each `event_type` and calculate the average of occurrences from `Events` table. Then join the selection result with the original `Events` table using the field `event_type`, and keep the `business_id`s such that more than one event type with occurrences greater than the average occurrences of that event type.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select business_id from Events e1 right join
    (select event_type, avg(occurences) as avg_occurences from Events group by event_type) e2
    on e1.event_type = e2.event_type
    group by e1.business_id
    having sum(if(e1.occurences > e2.avg_occurences, 1, 0)) > 1;
```
