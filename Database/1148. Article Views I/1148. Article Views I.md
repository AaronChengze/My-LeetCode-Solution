## Description
Table: `Views`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
```

Write an SQL query to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles, sorted in ascending order by their id.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Result table:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 4    |
| 7    |
+------+
```

## Solution
If an author has reviewed at least one of his or her own articles, then there must exist an entry in table `Views` such that `author_id` and `viewer_id` have the same value. Therefore, select the field `author_id` the entries from table `Views` where `author_id` and `viewer_id` have the same value, use `distinct` to avoid duplicates, and sort the result in ascending order.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct author_id as id from Views where author_id = viewer_id order by author_id asc;
```
