Write an SQL query to find for each user, whether the brand of the second item (by date) they sold is their favorite brand. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as no.

It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on a day.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Users table:
+---------+------------+----------------+
| user_id | join_date  | favorite_brand |
+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2019-01-01 | Lenovo         |
| 2       | 2019-02-09 | Samsung        |
| 3       | 2019-01-19 | LG             |
| 4       | 2019-05-21 | HP             |
+---------+------------+----------------+

Orders table:
+----------+------------+---------+----------+-----------+
| order_id | order_date | item_id | buyer_id | seller_id |
+----------+------------+---------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | 2019-08-01 | 4       | 1        | 2         |
| 2        | 2019-08-02 | 2       | 1        | 3         |
| 3        | 2019-08-03 | 3       | 2        | 3         |
| 4        | 2019-08-04 | 1       | 4        | 2         |
| 5        | 2019-08-04 | 1       | 3        | 4         |
| 6        | 2019-08-05 | 2       | 2        | 4         |
+----------+------------+---------+----------+-----------+

Items table:
+---------+------------+
| item_id | item_brand |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Samsung    |
| 2       | Lenovo     |
| 3       | LG         |
| 4       | HP         |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+-----------+--------------------+
| seller_id | 2nd_item_fav_brand |
+-----------+--------------------+
| 1         | no                 |
| 2         | yes                |
| 3         | yes                |
| 4         | no                 |
+-----------+--------------------+

The answer for the user with id 1 is no because they sold nothing.
The answer for the users with id 2 and 3 is yes because the brands of their second sold items are their favorite brands.
The answer for the user with id 4 is no because the brand of their second sold item is not their favorite brand.
```

## Solution
Join the tables `Users`, `Orders` and `Items` using `Users.user_id = Orders.seller_id` and `Orders.item_id = Items.item_id`. Then select `user_id` as `seller_id`, and use `case when` to determine the answers. If the count of `Orders.item_id` is less than 2, then the answer is no. Otherwise, use `limit 1 offset 1` to select the second item sold and check whether it is the user's favorite brand.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select user_id as seller_id,
    case
        when count(o.item_id) < 2 then "no"
        when (select i1.item_brand from Users u1, Orders o1, Items i1
            where u1.user_id = u.user_id and u1.user_id = o1.seller_id and o1.item_id = i1.item_id
            order by order_date asc limit 1 offset 1) = u.favorite_brand then "yes" else "no"
    end
    as 2nd_item_fav_brand
    from Users u left join Orders o on u.user_id = o.seller_id
    left join Items i on o.item_id = i.item_id
    group by user_id;
```
