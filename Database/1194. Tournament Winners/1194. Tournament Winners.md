## Description
Table: `Players`
```
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.
```
Table: `Matches`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belongs to the same group.
```

The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the **lowest** player_id wins.

Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Players table:
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |
| 25        | 1          |
| 30        | 1          |
| 45        | 1          |
| 10        | 2          |
| 35        | 2          |
| 50        | 2          |
| 20        | 3          |
| 40        | 3          |
+-----------+------------+

Matches table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| match_id   | first_player | second_player | first_score | second_score |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | 15           | 45            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 25            | 1           | 2            |
| 3          | 30           | 15            | 2           | 0            |
| 4          | 40           | 20            | 5           | 2            |
| 5          | 35           | 50            | 1           | 1            |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+------------+
| group_id  | player_id  |
+-----------+------------+ 
| 1         | 15         |
| 2         | 35         |
| 3         | 40         |
+-----------+------------+
```

## Solution
First, join tables `Match` and `Players` to calculate each player's total score.

Next, sort the results according to group id in ascending order, total score in descending order and player id in ascending order.

Finally, group the results by group id so that each group's winner is remained.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select t.group_id, t.player_id from (
    select p.group_id, p.player_id, sum(m.player_score) as score_total from (
        select match_id, first_player as player_id, first_score as player_score from Matches
            union all
        select match_id, second_player as player_id, second_score as player_score from Matches
    ) m
        left join Players p on m.player_id = p.player_id
        group by p.group_id, p.player_id
        order by p.group_id asc, score_total desc, p.player_id asc
) t
    group by t.group_id;
```
