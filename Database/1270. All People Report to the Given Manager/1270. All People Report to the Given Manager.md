## Description
Table: `Employees`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
```

Write an SQL query to find `employee_id` of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers as the company is small.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+

The head of the company is the employee with employee_id 1.
The employees with employee_id 2 and 77 report their work directly to the head of the company.
The employee with employee_id 4 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 4 --> 2 --> 1. 
The employee with employee_id 7 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 7 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1.
The employees with employee_id 3, 8 and 9 don't report their work to head of company directly or indirectly.
```

## Solution
Since the indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers, consider the three cases of different number of managers of the direct/indirect relation between managers.

1. An employee directly reports to the head of the company.
2. An employee directly reports to a manager, and the manager directly reports to the head of the company.
3. An employee directly reports to manager 1, manager 1 directly reports to manager 2, and manager 2 directly reports to the head of the company.

For each case, select the corresponding employees and union the results.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select employee_id from Employees where manager_id = 1 and employee_id != 1
union
select e1.employee_id
    from Employees e1,
        (select employee_id from Employees where manager_id = 1 and employee_id != 1) manager
    where manager_id = manager.employee_id
union
select e2.employee_id
    from Employees e2,
        (select e1.employee_id employee_id
            from Employees e1,
                (select employee_id from Employees where manager_id = 1 and employee_id != 1) manager
            where manager_id = manager.employee_id) e3
    where manager_id = e3.employee_id;
