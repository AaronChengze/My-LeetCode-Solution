## Solution
1. Join table `MovieRating` with table `Users` using `user_id`. The entries are grouped by `Movie_Rating.user_id` and sorted by `count` in descending order and by `name` in ascending order. Select 1 entry.
2. Join table `MovieRating` with table `Movies` using `movie_id`, using `created_at` as a filter. The entries are grouped by `Moving_rating.movie_id` and sorted by `avg(rating)` in descending order and by `title` in ascending order. Select 1 entry.

Use `union all` to union the two selection results into one result table.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
(select name as results
    from Movie_Rating join Users
    on Movie_Rating.user_id = Users.user_id
    group by Movie_Rating.user_id
    order by count(*) desc, name
    limit 1)
union all
(select title as results
    from Movie_Rating join Movies
    on Movie_Rating.movie_id = Movies.movie_id
    where created_at between '2020-02-01' and '2020-02-29'
    group by Movie_Rating.movie_id
    order by avg(rating) desc, title
    limit 1);
```
