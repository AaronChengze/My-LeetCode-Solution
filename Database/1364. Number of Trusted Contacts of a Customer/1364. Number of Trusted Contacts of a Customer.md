## Level
Medium

## Description
Table: `Customers`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
| email         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the email of a customer of an online shop.
```

Table: `Contacts`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | id      |
| contact_name  | varchar |
| contact_email | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, contact_email) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and email of one contact of customer with user_id.
This table contains information about people each customer trust. The contact may or may not exist in the Customers table.
```

Table: `Invoices`
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| invoice_id   | int     |
| price        | int     |
| user_id      | int     |
+--------------+---------+
invoice_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has an invoice with invoice_id and a price.
```

Write an SQL query to find the following for each `invoice_id`:

* `customer_name`: The name of the customer the invoice is related to.
* `price`: The price of the invoice.
* `contacts_cnt`: The number of contacts related to the customer.
* `trusted_contacts_cnt`: The number of contacts related to the customer and at the same time they are customers to the shop. (i.e His/Her email exists in the Customers table.)

Order the result table by `invoice_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Customers table:

Bob has two contacts, none of them is a trusted contact.
Alex has one contact and it is a trusted contact (Alice).
John doesn't have any contacts.
```

## Solution
The fields `invoice_id`, `customer_name` and `price` in the result table can be obtained by joining tables `Invoices` and `Customers`.

For the fields `contacts_cnt` and `trusted_contacts_cnt`, join tables `Contacts` and `Customers`. The field `contacts_cnt` is the number of entries in `Contacts` for each `user_id`. The field `trusted_contacts_cnt` is the number of entries in table `Contacts` for each `user_id` such that `contact_name` and `contact_email` are in table `Customers`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select t1.invoice_id, t1.customer_name, t1.price,
    if(t2.contacts_cnt is null, 0, contacts_cnt) as contacts_cnt,
    if(t2.trusted_contacts_cnt is null, 0, trusted_contacts_cnt) as trusted_contacts_cnt
    from (
        select i.invoice_id, cu1.customer_name, i.price, i.user_id from
            Invoices i left join Customers cu1 on i.user_id = cu1.customer_id
    ) t1
    left join (
        select co.user_id, count(*) as contacts_cnt, sum(if(cu2.customer_name is null, 0, 1)) as trusted_contacts_cnt
            from Contacts co left join Customers cu2 on co.contact_email = cu2.email
            group by co.user_id
    ) t2
    on t1.user_id = t2.user_id
    order by t1.invoice_id asc;
```
