Table: `Rides`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
```

Write an SQL query to report the distance travelled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by `travelled_distance` in **descending order**, if two or more users travelled the same distance, order them by their `name` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
```
Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+

Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Elvis and Lee travelled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveller as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald didn't have any rides, the distance travelled by him is 0.
```

## Solution
Join the tables `Users` and `Rides` using `Users.id = Rides.user_id`. For each user, obtain the total distance and sort the result table according to `travelled_distance` in descending order and then according to `name` in ascending order. Use `ifnull` to make the results of users that do not have any rides 0.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name, ifnull(sum(distance), 0) as travelled_distance
    from Users left join Rides on Users.id = Rides.user_id
    group by Users.id
    order by travelled_distance desc, name asc;
```
