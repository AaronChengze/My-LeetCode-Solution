| student_id    | int     |

```

A "quiet" student is the one who took at least one exam and didn't score neither the high score nor the low score.

Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being "quiet" in **ALL** exams.

Don't return the student who has never taken any exam. Return the result table **ordered** by student_id.

The query result format is in the following example.
```
Student table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Jade          |
| 3           | Stella        |
| 4           | Jonathan      |
| 5           | Will          |
+-------------+---------------+

Exam table:
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| exam_id    | student_id   | score     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| 10         |     1        |    70     |
| 10         |     2        |    80     |
| 10         |     3        |    90     |
| 20         |     1        |    80     |
| 30         |     1        |    70     |
| 30         |     3        |    80     |
| 30         |     4        |    90     |
| 40         |     1        |    60     |
| 40         |     2        |    70     |
| 40         |     4        |    80     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2           | Jade          |
+-------------+---------------+

For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high score respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exam.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.
```

## Solution
First, for each exam, select the maximum score and the minimum score.

Secondly, for each student, check whether the student did not score the maximum score or the minimum score, and select such students in the result.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select student_id, student_name from Student s
    where student_id in (
        select student_id from Exam e, (
            select exam_id, max(score) as max_score, min(score) as min_score from Exam group by exam_id
        ) maxmin where e.exam_id = maxmin.exam_id
            group by e.student_id
            having sum(e.score = maxmin.max_score) = 0 and sum(e.score = maxmin.min_score) = 0
    );
```
