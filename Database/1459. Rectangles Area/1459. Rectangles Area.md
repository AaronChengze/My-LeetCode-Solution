## Description
Table: `Points`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| x_value       | int     |
| y_value       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each point is represented as a 2D Dimensional (x_value, y_value).
```
Write an SQL query to report of all possible rectangles which can be formed by any two points of the table.

Each row in the result contains three columns (p1, p2, area) where:

* **p1** and **p2** are the id of two opposite corners of a rectangle and p1 < p2.
* Area of this rectangle is represented by the column **area**.

Report the query in descending order by area in case of tie in ascending order by p1 and p2.
```
Points table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| id       | x_value     | y_value     |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 1        | 2           | 8           |
| 2        | 4           | 7           |
| 3        | 2           | 10          |
+----------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| p1       | p2          | area        |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 2        | 3           | 6           |
| 1        | 2           | 2           |
+----------+-------------+-------------+

p1 should be less than p2 and area greater than 0.
p1 = 1 and p2 = 2, has an area equal to |2-4| * |8-7| = 2.
p1 = 2 and p2 = 3, has an area equal to |4-2| * |7-10| = 6.
p1 = 1 and p2 = 3 It's not possible because the rectangle has an area equal to 0.
```

## Solution
For each pair of points `p1` and `p2`, if their `x_value`s and `y_value`s are both different, then they can form a rectangle, where the area of the rectangle can be calculated using their `x_value`s and `y_value`s.

Select such pairs of points and calculate the areas accordingly. Sort the result table according to `area` in descending order and then according to `p1` and `p2` in ascending order.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select point1.id as p1, point2.id as p2, abs((point1.x_value - point2.x_value) * (point1.y_value - point2.y_value)) as area
    from Points point1 join Points point2 on point1.id < point2.id 
    where point1.x_value != point2.x_value and point1.y_value != point2.y_value 
    order by area desc, p1, p2;
```
