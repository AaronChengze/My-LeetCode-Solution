# 1613. Find the Missing IDs
## Level
Medium

## Description
Table: `Customers`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
```

Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the `Customers` table but are in the range between 1 and the **maximum** `customer_id` present in the table.

**Notice** that the maximum `customer_id` will not exceed `100`.

Return the result table ordered by `ids` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Customer table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2 and 3 are missing from the table.
```

## Solution
Generate all numbers from 1 to 100, and select the numbers in the range from 1 to 100 and not in `customer_id`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select ids from (
    select x * 10 + y + 1 as ids from (
        select 0 x union select 1 union select 2 union select 3 union select 4 union select 5 union select 6 union select 7 union select 8 union select 9
    ) as tens, (
        select 0 y union select 1 union select 2 union select 3 union select 4 union select 5 union select 6 union select 7 union select 8 union select 9
    ) as ones
    order by ids) as num
    where ids < (select max(customer_id) from Customers)
    and ids not in (select distinct customer_id from Customers);
```
